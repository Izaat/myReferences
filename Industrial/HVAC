01. Cooling Tower (For Water Cooled Chillers)
    Warm Water inlet > Distribution Header > Spray Nozzles > Cooling Fins > Collection Tank > Cooled Water out (Flow of water will be from top to bottom, opposite the flow of air)
    Warm Air out        <----------------------------------- Cooling Fins <--------------------------  Cool air in (Air flow will be from bottom to top against the flow of water)
    Fan will exhaust the warm air
    All stray mist sucked by the fan will condense by another fin located below the fan (Second layer cooling fin)

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
02. AHU    

    Return Line: Hot Air Exhaust
        Grills > Wall > Dampers > Fan > Duct
        <--------------------------------- Air Flow
    Supply Line: Fresh Air Intake (Usually 10% fresh air needs to flow into the system)
        Grills > Wall > Dampers > Panel Filter > Bag Filter > Heater > Cooler > Fan > Duct
        ---------------------------------> Air Flow
    Recirculation Dampers
        Recirculation are connected between Return Line and Supply Line. 
        Controlled Mechanically or by BMS System
        Located between the Supply dampers and fan in Return Line, and between dampers and panel filter in Supply Line     
        Connects Extraction/Exhaust duct and Supply Duct
    Dampers (Open Supply dampers if CO2 is too high)
        Return and Supply dampers are interlocked with each other. If Supply Dampers are open 100%, Return Dampers will follow
        BMS Dampers are opposite of Supply Dampers. If Supply is open 100%, BMS Dampers will close at 0%, disconnecting Return and Supply lines
    Check Filter Condition: Pressure differential sensors    
        Pressure before and after filter needs to be equal
        If pressure of compartment after the filter is lower than the compartment before the filter, then filter is dirty
    Heater (Applicable for cold climates)
        Connected to Boiler or electrical heater
        Cooler water enters from base inlet and exits at top outlet
    Cooler (CHW)
        Connected to chilled water system
        Cool water enters from the base inlet and exits at top outlet

        Motor controlled by VFD linked to BMS System
    Base of AHU
        Drain pan is fitted underneath AHU to collect condensed water and drain hole connected to the drain pipe
    Frost Temperature Sensor (Applicable for cold climates)

03. Chiller
    
    2 Types of Chiller
        Water Cooled Chiller, (Indoor & Outdoor): Will be linked to or integrated with outdoor cooling tower, 
        Air Cooled Chiller, (Outdoor): No cooling tower, 
        
    Water that supplies to AHU (Chilled Water)
        Chiller to AHU: Water at 6 degree water (via pump)
        AHU to Chiller: Water at 12 degree

    Water that supplies to Cooling Tower (Condenser Water)
        Tower to Chiller: 27 degree
        Chiller to Tower: 32 degree (via pump)

    4 Main components of a Chiller
        Evaporator
        Condenser
        Compressor
        Expansion Valve

    3 Main Circuits of a Chiller
        Evaporation Loop (Evaporator > Compressor > Condenser > Expansion Valve) > Back to Evaporator
        Chilled Water Loop (AHU > Evaporator > Back to AHU)
        Condensed Water Looop (Tower > Condenser > Back to Tower)
        
    Air Cooled Chiller Components
        Condenser Cooling Fans (Takes heat away from refrigerant)
        Compressor (Circulates refrigerant to condensers)
            Types: Reciprocating (Piston), Scroll, Rotary Screw
            Refrigerant leaves compressor as high pressure, high temperature, superheated vapor
        Condenser
            Refrigerant leaves condenser as high pressure, medium temperature, saturated liquid
            Distribution Headers (Near compressor)
            Multiple pass condenser (Categorized by numbers of passes)
            Collection Headers (Near Dryer)
        Filter Dryer
            Refrigerant leaves Dryer as high pressure, medium temperature, saturated liquid
            Absorbs moisture (Moisture will damage the circuit)
            Cylindrical Shape
        Expansion Valve
            Refrigerant leaves Expansion valve as low pressure, low temperature, liquid vapor mixture
            A tube installed perpendicular to the pipes located right before foam wrapped pipes
        Evaporator (Cools down Chilled Water)
            Water travels in the opposite direction to the flow of refrigerant (Direction is for maximum heat transfer and LMTD - Log Mean Temperature Difference)
            Refrigerant leaves Evaporator as low pressure, low temperature saturated vapor
            Shell and tube heat exhanger (A distributed network of refrigerant pipings contained within the tank)
            Water flow within the evaporator is tubulent (flow being slowed down rapidly) as it makes multiple 90 degrees turns all the way through the tank
        Cycle
            Compressor -> Condenser -> Dryer -> Expansion Valve -> Evaporator -> Compressor
    
    Gas Charging
        Turn gas supply tank upside down while charging
        Red Line (Gauge) -> Large Valve (High Sight)
        Blue Line (Gauge) -> Smaller Valve (Low Sight)
        Center Line (Gauge) -> Gas Supply Tank
        Purge out contaminated air from hoses by rapidly loosen and retighten the hose
        Charge when the compressor is running
        Open the blue line and see if the red line is slowly increasing

    Thermal Expansion Valve (TXV) 
        Refrigerant within the evaporator is in liquid form (incompressible), therefore pressure needs to be controlled before entering the compressor
        Acts like a control valve (Normally Closed) increasing and decreasing the amount of refrigerant entering the evaporator, mechanically controlled by Sensing Bulb
        Sensing bulb contains refrigerant and this controls the diaphram located inside the Power Head which in turn controls the amount of flow via piston pin (removable orifice)
        Components  
            Refrigerant outlet port
            Refrigerant inlet port
            Adjustable Port Screw (With Removable cap)
                Controls the tension spring that controls the diaphragm
            Power Head (Coil with thin tubings aka Capillary Tube, Sensing Bulb attached at the end of the tube)
                The bulb senses the superheat
                The bulb will be located at the other end of the evaporator (the refrigerant outlet), away from the TXV main body
        Sensing Bulb
            When the refrigerant boils, it increases the pressure, and the pressure increases the flow in the TXV via the diaphragm and piston
            When the refrigerant is cold, pressure decreases, and this decreases the flow in the TXV
            The hotter it is, the more refrigerant will flow into the evaporator

04. Chiller Cooling Capacity: Calculation
    
    Units: kW, BTUs, Refrigeration Tons (RTs)

    Example using water cooled chiller:
        Volume flow rate
        Water Temperature Out (Evaporator Side, building to evaporator)
        Water Temperature In (Evaporator Side, evaporator to building)
        Density of water @ Average Temperature (AvTemp)
        Specific heat capacity of water @ Average Temperature
        
        (Temp In + Temp Out) / 2

    Converter

        specific heat capacity converter

    /////////////////////////
    Calculation: METRIC
        Volume Flow Rate: 0.0995 m^3/s
        Water Temperature Out: 6'C
        Water Temperature In: 12'C
        Density of water @ AvTemp: 999.78 kg/m^3
        Specific heat capacity of water @ AvTemp: 4.19 kJ/kg.K

        Formula
            Q = (V * rho) * Cp * (Water Temp In (K) - Water Temp Out (K))
            Where:
                Q = Heat Transfer
                V = Volume flow rate (m^3/s)
                rho = Density of Water (kg/m^3)
                V*rho = Mass flow rate (kg/s)
                Cp = Specific Heat Capacity kJ/kg.K
                K = Kelvin (Temp)
                C = Celsius (Temp)
            Therefore:
            Celsius to Kelvins = Temp in Celsius + 273.15
            Q = (0.0995 * 999.78) * 4.19 * [ (12 + 273.15K) - (6 + 273.15K) }
              =    99.48 kg/s     * 4.19 * [285.15 - 279.15]
              =    99.48 kg/s     * 4.19 * 6 Kelvins
              = 2500.879 kW (Refrigeration effect)

            RT = 2500.879kW / 3.517
               = 711 Refrigeration Tons
            BTU/h = 2500.879kW x 3412.142 
                  = 8533354 BTU/h

    Calculation: IMPERIAL
        Volume Flow Rate: 12,649 ft^3/h
        Water Temperature Out: 42.8'F
        Water Temperature In: 53.6'F
        Density of water @ AvTemp: 62.414lb/ft3
        Specific heat capacity of water @ AvTemp: 1.0007643 BTU/lb.F

        Formula
            Q = (V * rho) * Cp * (Water Temp In (K) - Water Temp Out (K))
            Where:
                Q = Heat Transfer (BTU/h)
                V = Volume flow rate (ft^3/h)
                rho = Density of Water (lb/ft^3)
                V*rho = Mass flow rate (lb/h)
                Cp = Specific Heat Capacity (BTU/lb.F)
                F = Fahrenheit (Temp)
                RT = Refrigeration Ton
                
            Therefore:
            Celsius to Kelvins = Temp in Celsius + 273.15
            Q = (12,649 * 62.414) * 1.0007643 * [ 53.6 - 42.8 ]
                = 789474.686 lb/h * 1.0007643 * 10.8
                = 8532843.28 BTU/h (Refrigeration effect)
                
            RT = 8532843.28 / 12000
                 = 711.07 Refrigeration Tons
            kW = 711.07RT x 3.517
                       = 2500.834kW

05. Fan Coil Unit
    
    Used to condition local air to suit the temperature requirements of immediate space
    Located near the AHU Main Supply Duct and before the squareish ceiling diffuser/vent (Usually hidden in the office ceiling or exposed in airconditioned canteen)
    FCU are not connected to the Main Suppply Duct by ducting
    It only recirculates air in the room (Think of standalone standing fan with intake filter)
    Unlike standalone fans, FCUs treat the air temperature through another series cooling and heating (Think of miniaturized AHU - Supply Line) 
    Basically a standalone mini-version of the AHU.

    Intake > Fan > HeatCoil / Cooling > Ducting > Ceiling Diffuser/Vent

06. VAV System (Variable Air Volume System)

    Overview
    VAV Terminal
    Fan assisted VAV terminal
    VAV System operation
    
    Overview
        Supply air temperature is kept at constant
        Volume/Flow Rate of air supply is varied
        VAVs are more energy efficient than CAV (Constant Air Volume System)
        CAVs are easier to install than VAVs
        CAVs are installed above ceilings and users can't control the temperature of individual room (Centralized temperature)
        VAVs can control multiple rooms individually (ie Room A colder than room B)
        Heatloading
            Number of people/equipment in the room
            Direct sunlight/shade position of the room
            etc
        CAVs are just simple ductings that redirects cold air to a room through a diffuser (Ceiling outlet) - This will look like simple 90deg pipe
        Like CAVs, VAVs are connected to the AHU's Supply Duct (AHU Air Output - Cold Air), where Return Duct is the input of AHU (warm air)
        Unlike CAVs, VAVs has "VAV Terminal" in between.
        Typical temperature of Supply Air (AHU Output) = 13degC

    VAV Terminal
        A box like structure located in roof ceiling, installed between AHU Supply duct and the Ceiling Diffuser (Ceiling Outlet)
        CAVs are installed directly to the AHU, BUT VAVs has a box like structure to control a zone
        Every VAV Terminal has 
            Wall mounted thermostat, 
            Butterfly valve / damper controller (to control air supply from AHU Supply Duct), 
            Reheater unit (For colder countries)
            Air Flow sensor 
                Located before the damper and this controls the damper controller
                This will be located at the center of the cross-section of duct (Note: Air flows the fastest at the center of pipes than the walls of pipes)
                To calculate the average air flow, the sensor will require an "X-Shape" structure made of pipes in the ducting
        Control Panel
            Controller >
                Pressure Sensor > Airflow sensor
                Transformer
                Thermostat
                Actuator > Shaft > Damper
                Link to other devices ie BMS or Computer
        Dampers doesn't usually close fully (For fresh air to enter the room)

    Fan Assisted VAV Terminal
        This centrifugal type fan will be located next to the VAV Terminal to redirect air from the room and back into the VAV Terminal
        Inlet of this fan is usually contains a filter

    VAV System Operation
        Because of the variable damping system, the supply air duct fluctuates in air pressure
        Example:
            If all dampers along the AHU Supply Duct are open at 100%, the VAV Terminal nearest to the AHU will get most of the supply air pressure
            And pressure furthest from the AHU will experience pressure drop due to the first VAV Terminal
        To solve this problem, a pressure sensor will be installed at the furthest end of the AHU Supply duct, 
        This pressure sensor will control the AHU's outlet fan's VFD drive
        If the pressure at the furthest end of the duct is low, the VFD will increase the speed of the AHU's outlet fan, hence increasing the pressure
