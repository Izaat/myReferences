01. Overview
    A method to achieve maximum equipment effectiveness through employee involvement (Management+Operators+Maintenance) 
    
    TPM:
        Increases the efficiency of the operation by ensuring the equipment is safe, available, and working correctly.
        Strengthens morale and collaboration
        Saves money as unplanned reactive maintenance declines and planned/proactive maintenance increases
            Total cost of unplanned breakdown is high when the equipment is taken offline for repair
        Zero Accident, Zero Defect, Zero Breakdown

    6 Big Losses: -
        To use a metric (OEE) which allows to quantify the 6 major types of equipment losses
        
        //Availability Losses
            1. Breakdowns: Affects availability                                        
            2. Setup and Adjustments: Machine preparation for different type of products
        //Performance Losses
            3. Minor Stoppages: Short stoppages of machine 
            4. Reduced Speed: Lower productivity output due to machine operating at lower speed than intended design
        //Defect Losses
            5. Rework & Defects: When machine produces bad parts
            6. Startup Losses: Fine tuning of machine/parts when production gets started

        Alot of companies have far more capacity than they expected when 6 big losses been eliminated.
        This will help companies to win more business at lower cost

    8 Pillars of TPM
        1. Focused Improvement / Kaizen
        2. Autonomous Improvement
        3. Planned Maintenance
        4. Technical Training
        5. Early Equipment Management
        6. Quality Maintenance
        7. Office TPM
        8. Safety and Environment

    TPM - 5 Foundations and 4 levels

    TPM Targets:
        Obtain at least 80% Production Efficiency
        Obtain at least 90% Overall Equipment Effectiveness
        Accident Free Environment
        Multi skilled and flexible workers
        100% successful goods delivered


    8 Wastes of Lean (TPM)
        Defects : Process variability due to poor maintenance
        Overproduction : Poor planning and scheduling and misprioritizing work
        Waiting : Maintenance waits for production to release equipment
        Unutilized talent
        Transportation : Expedited freight to handle emergency repairs
        Inventory : 
        Motion : Repetitive trips by texhs to access, order and repair (Finding missing tools)
        Excessive Processing : Using highly paid maintenance techs to do simple maintenance functions

02. Autonomous, Planned and Early Management
    
    Autonomous Maintenance
        Operator Managed Tasks
            Simplified inspections and monitoring (i.e Torqued bolt markings via visual inspection)
        Documented maintenance activities
        Training and certification        

    Planned Maintenance    
        5S
            Organize, Clean and Shine equipment
            
        Visual Controls
            Simplify communications
            Smart visuals to set direction
            
        Planning and scheduling
            Work order documentation
            Prioritization of work
            Controlled scheduling

    Early Equipment Management
        Preventive maintenanace
            Greasing, Tightening, Filter change, other repetitive tasks
        Documented PMs
            Daily, weekly, monthly, annual, etc
        Annual schedules
        Downtime tracking
            By documenting how long machine is running, balance hours will be considered as the downtime

03. Implementation Roadmap

    Charter an interdisciplinary team

            Add visual controls
        Step 3:
            Start measuring OEE, measure downtime and uptime
            Identify KPIs
            Setup visual activity board
        Step 4:
