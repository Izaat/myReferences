            Sketching | Inking | Filling
                On the right hand side panel, open the Object Data Properties Tab and add in the layers for the sketch, Ink and filling
                Keyboard E : Start new line at the end of the line you've just drawn

    Add Modifiers on top of the inked and filled animations, without modifiers, the object is not anchored
        //Without the modifiers, theh character will rotate anywhere withing the 3D space
        //But we need to snap the character's botton to the workspace floor
        //To do this: 
            Rename th e Stroke Object to Character
            Go to edit mode
            Use the select cursor (located on the right hand side toolbar)
            select the lines that are supposed to be anchored to the 'floor'
            Activate 3D cursor
                Top right  hand side toolbar, click on the overlay icon (2 circles in black and white)
                3D Cursor checkbox needs to be checked

                    Right Click on the character
                    Set Origin > Origin to 3D cursor
            Once done, you can now rotate the character around its selected lines
        //Time offset modifier - Cycling a set of frames number of times          
            In Object mode, adjust the 'End' frames to specific time (The bottom of screen) - Let say End = 200
            Right hand side panel - Modifier Properties (Wrench Icon) > Add Time Offset 
                Custom Range - The selected single cycle of frames
                Keep Loop : Checkbox checked - for looping through end frame of 200
                Shift+D to duplicate the entire cycle (If you modify the original, the duplicated ones won't be modified)
                Alt+D to create instance of the cycle (Instance means when you modify the original, the instances will follow with the modified drawings)
                Alt  + S/G/R (Scale, Grab, Rotate) to reset to original parameters
                Frame Offset : If you duplicate a cycle and adjust the frame offset to one of it, the cycling steps wont follow the duplicated ones
        //Noise modifier
            Factor : The higher the number, the more lines will flicker
        //Thickness modifier
            Thickness Factor : The higher the number, the thicker the lines
        //Tint modifier
            Changes the entire colour of the cycle without changing the color frame by frame  
    
    
    Coordinating the cycle through the camera
        Move the entire cycle to offscreen
        From the ObjectMode > Timeline Panel > Editing Context View > GreasePencil, change from GreasePencil to DopeSheet  
            This will open up the keyframe timeline panel of Dopesheet
            Highlight the Cycle,
            With mouse cursor over at the drawings panel,

    At the top right hand corner (Scene text input box) - Cone and black sphere icon
        Linked Copy = Instances of the scenes
        Full Copy = Duplication of the scene
        Rename the Scene name
        Now you can select between few scenes.
    Editing many scenes together
        Create new scene

05. Head Rigging
    //Sketching
        Start a new 2D Drawing
            Sketch a head
        Create a sub folder under Collection folder and name it Sketch
            Move the sketches into this folder
        Create another subfolder under collection and name this GP
            In Object Mode, Add a new GP (Blank) and name it headbase file.
            Outline your sketches into separate layers (Headbase, etc) in the headbase under layer section 
            Adding another drawing in the same layer - Head Outline, Fill Coloring and Mouth will be in the same layer.
                In Object Mode, select the head layer. 
                    In Properties Panel, Open the Layer Properties Tab
                    Under Layer Section, Add a new layer and name it Fill Color
                        Open the Draw Mode and draw the fill color      
            Masking Mouthbase
                In Object Mode, select the head layer. 
                    In Properties Panel, Open the Layer Properties Tab
                    Under Layer Section, Add a new layer and name it Mouth for the mouth winkle line
                        Open the Draw Mode and draw the line                        
                    In Layer Properties Tab, check the Mask Checkbox and add a mask layer.
                        Select the head layer (Fill Color)
                        Open the edit mode. Grab mouth layer and now you can move the mouth without the head moving
                
    //Rigging
        //Add Lattices
            In Object Mode menu, click on Add button and select Lattices
                Move the lattice to the object, resize the bounding box to wrap all the layers of the object in 3D space
                NOTE: Head lattice for the head, Brows lattice for the individual brows
                In the properties tab > lattice properties,
                    Increase the resolution
                    U = X axis
                    V  = Y axis
                    W = Z axis
                Select the object (inside the bounding lattices)
                    Open the settings properties > Add Modifier > Select Lattice
                        In the Object Text box, select the object name
                Go to Edit mode and select the lattice, grab and move. You'll see it bend.
        //Add Single bone to assign to the lattice
            NOTE: All ends of sub bones will follow the Parent bones. Create Parent-sub-sub-n bones for more flexible look
            In Object Mode menu, click on Add button and select Single Bone
            In Properties Panel, 3 new property tabs will appear
                Object Data properties, Bone Properties and Bone Constraints Properties
                In Object Data Properties, open 'Motion Paths Section'
                    Check 'Infront' Check box so your skeleton will always appear infront of the object
                In 'Viewport Display' section, change 'Display As' to Stick instead of the default 'Octahedral'
            NOTE: Add Root bone first (the central bone) 
                Once you've aligned the bone, open the Bone Properties Tab and rename it to Root
                Adding Bone Layer under Root Bone
                    Open Object Data Properties and under the Skeleton Section > Layers, click on another box
            Add another bone
                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVl7FQw-x6M
                In Edit Mode
                    Click on the circular orb at the end of the bone and press E. Move mouse to the desired position
                        OR: HOLD SHIFT+A
                    Change Layers of the bone
                        Highlight the bone, change to Pose Mode, click on the Pose button and select "Change Bone Layers"
                        -OR- Press M
            Assigning to the Lattice Group   
                Open Object Mode and select the Lattice
                    Open Modifier Properties Tab and Add Modifier
                        In Object Text Box, select Armature
                Open Object Data Properties Tab
                    In Vertex Group Section, add Vertex Groups by clicking on the + button
                    Name the group to the exact name of the bone assigned to the Lattice
                Open Object Mode and Select Lattice
                    Open Edit Mode and box select the lattices and the corresponding bone
                    In Object Data Properties Tab, in Vertex Group Section, select the group name and click on 'Assign'
            Open Pose Mode (Select Bone first and open Pose Mode)
                Now you can move the assigned bone and see the object move along with it.
            Bendy Bone Option
                This option make the lattices of your assigned object have hose-like texture when it bends
                In Pose Mode, go to Bone Properties Tab and open up the Bendy Bones section
                    Change the number of the Segment
            Mirroring        
                CTRL + M : Mirror copy to the 3D cursor
