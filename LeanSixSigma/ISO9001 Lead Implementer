    Quality management Principles

            Customer Focus
                To meet customer requirements and strive to exceed expectations
            Leadership

            People engagement
                It is essential that people are competent, empowered and engaged in delivering value
            Process Approach

    Quality Management System   
        Is a systematic approach for quality management and for enhancing customer satisfaction
        QMS is a set of policies, procedures and instructions that sets internal rule that governs the company on how to create and deliver product or services to customers
            Explain to employees what the best practice is in order to determine the needs and expectations of the customers,
            Establish control of processes to ensure that employees deliver what can be expected from them
        The quality management controls are not only technical, but they can be a combination of both types of controls
            Organizational Control - Documentation of procedures
            Engineering Control - Implementation of new technologies
            HR Related Control - Training of People
        Quality: The level of fulfillment of customer expectations

    Implementation requirements
        ISO9001 specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing and maintaining the QMS
        Standards to be implemented and maintained through PDCA cycle
        Plan
            What to do and how to do it
            Understanding the context of the organization
            Define Scope, Quality Policy, Risks and Opportunities, quality objectives and control of processes
        Do 
            Implementation of the plan defined in Plan Phase
            Fulfilling QMS requirements
            Achieve quality objectives
            Implement control of processes

        Act            
            Improving the way things being done
            Implement corrective actions and improvement intiatives

    Implementing ISO9001 as a project
        Form a team and assign them to concrete roles
        Roles:
            Project Manager
                Person that coordinates project for the implementation of ISO9001
            Project Team 
                Any person under coordination of PM will be included in documenting and implementing the process controls
                Assist to organize and give advices on the changes made
            Management Representative
                Responsible for maintaining QMS and its continual improvement
                Often this person is the project manager
            Top Management
                Responsible to support the process by showing commitment, setting objectives, making decisions and
                provide relevant resources by assigning the right people to dedicate time for implementation process
                Dedicate budget and other resources

    Documenting ISO9001 requirements
        QMS consists of set of policies, procedures and other controls that set rules
        What to document and to what level of details
            Check whether a document is required/mandatory by ISO9001
                Example: Results of Management review are mandatory to be documented
                The organization shall retain documented information of 
                    Quality Policy
                    Quality objectives and plans to achieve them
                    Records of training, skills, experience and qualifications
                    Criteria for evaluation and selection of suppliers
                    Monitoring and measuring equipment, calibration records
                    Product/service requirements review records
                    Records about design and development outputs review, inputs, controls, change records
                    Characteristics of product to be produced and service to be provided
                    Records about customer property
                    Production/service provision change control records
                    Records of conformity of product/service with acceptance criteria
                    Records of nonconforming outputs
                    Monitoring and measurement results
                    Internal audit program
                    Results of internal audits
                    Results of management review
                    Results of corrective actions
                    NOTE: 
                        Not every process needs a documented procedure
                        But useful to have additional policies and procedures documented
            Criteria for non-mandatory document
                Size of company
                    Smaller companies tend to have fewer documents so avoid writing a procedure for every small process
                    Makes more sense for MNCs with 10k employees to write policies where each have related procedures and every procedure has working instructions
                Importance and complexity
                    The more important and complex a process or activity is, the more likely you have to write the policy or procedure to describe it
                    This is to make sure everyone understands how to perform a process or activity to avoid breakdowns in the operations
                ISO9001 does not specify what kind of document is required for operating the QMS, it's up to the organization to document in a way it finds most appropriate
                Amount of documentation depends on the size and complexity of the products and services
    
    Benefits of ISO9001
        Improves credibility and image, ability to achieve higher quality since QMS is mandatory for the certified organization
        Improvement of customer satisfaction, higher chance to retain repeat customers
        Better process integration
            Easier to find improvements in efficiency and cost savings
            Drive efficiencies towards fewer errors
        Improve evidence for decision making
            Focused on applying resources to areas that improves efficiencies and increases cost savings with less trial and error to find the right decision
            Ability to visualize how much improvement has happened
        Create continual improvement culture
        Engagement of employees
            Employees who are engaged in continuous improvement projects are happier and more engaged
            Engaged employees are more productive
