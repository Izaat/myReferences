    Quality management Principles
        Used to enhance company performance and achieve success
        7 Principles:
            Customer Focus
                To meet customer requirements and strive to exceed expectations
            Leadership
                Leaders at all levels establish unity of purpose and direction
                People are engaged in achieving the quality objectives
            People engagement
                It is essential that people are competent, empowered and engaged in delivering value
            Process Approach
                Predictable and consistent results are achieved more effectively when activities are understood and managed as interrelated processes
            Improvement
                Successful organization has ongoing focus on improvement
            Evidence based decision making
                Decisions based on analysis and evaluation of data and information are more likely to produce desired result
            Relationship management
                For sustained success, organization manage their relationship with interested parties such as suppliers
    
    Quality Management System   
        Is a systematic approach for quality management and for enhancing customer satisfaction
        QMS is a set of policies, procedures and instructions that sets internal rule that governs the company on how to create and deliver product or services to customers
            Explain to employees what the best practice is in order to determine the needs and expectations of the customers,
            Establish control of processes to ensure that employees deliver what can be expected from them
        The quality management controls are not only technical, but they can be a combination of both types of controls
            Organizational Control - Documentation of procedures
            Engineering Control - Implementation of new technologies
            HR Related Control - Training of People
        Quality: The level of fulfillment of customer expectations

    Implementation requirements
        ISO9001 specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing and maintaining the QMS
        Standards to be implemented and maintained through PDCA cycle
        Plan
            What to do and how to do it
            Understanding the context of the organization
            Define Scope, Quality Policy, Risks and Opportunities, quality objectives and control of processes
        Do 
            Implementation of the plan defined in Plan Phase
            Fulfilling QMS requirements
            Achieve quality objectives
            Implement control of processes
        Check
            Confirm that thing run as planned
            Check all objectives are achieved
            Regular monitoring and measuring
            Internal audits and management reviews
        Act            
            Improving the way things being done
            Implement corrective actions and improvement intiatives

    Implementing ISO9001 as a project
        Form a team and assign them to concrete roles
        Roles:
            Project Manager
                Person that coordinates project for the implementation of ISO9001
            Project Team 
                Any person under coordination of PM will be included in documenting and implementing the process controls
                Assist to organize and give advices on the changes made
            Management Representative
                Responsible for maintaining QMS and its continual improvement
                Often this person is the project manager
            Top Management
                Responsible to support the process by showing commitment, setting objectives, making decisions and
                provide relevant resources by assigning the right people to dedicate time for implementation process
                Dedicate budget and other resources

    Documenting ISO9001 requirements
        QMS consists of set of policies, procedures and other controls that set rules
        What to document and to what level of details
            Check whether a document is required/mandatory by ISO9001
                Example: Results of Management review are mandatory to be documented
                The organization shall retain documented information of 
                    Quality Policy
                    Quality objectives and plans to achieve them
                    Records of training, skills, experience and qualifications
                    Criteria for evaluation and selection of suppliers
                    Monitoring and measuring equipment, calibration records
                    Product/service requirements review records
                    Records about design and development outputs review, inputs, controls, change records
                    Characteristics of product to be produced and service to be provided
                    Records about customer property
                    Production/service provision change control records
                    Records of conformity of product/service with acceptance criteria
                    Records of nonconforming outputs
                    Monitoring and measurement results
                    Internal audit program
                    Results of internal audits
                    Results of management review
                    Results of corrective actions
                    NOTE: 
                        Not every process needs a documented procedure
                        But useful to have additional policies and procedures documented
            Criteria for non-mandatory document
                Size of company
                    Smaller companies tend to have fewer documents so avoid writing a procedure for every small process
                    Makes more sense for MNCs with 10k employees to write policies where each have related procedures and every procedure has working instructions
                Importance and complexity
                    The more important and complex a process or activity is, the more likely you have to write the policy or procedure to describe it
                    This is to make sure everyone understands how to perform a process or activity to avoid breakdowns in the operations
                ISO9001 does not specify what kind of document is required for operating the QMS, it's up to the organization to document in a way it finds most appropriate
                Amount of documentation depends on the size and complexity of the products and services
    
    Benefits of ISO9001
        Improves credibility and image, ability to achieve higher quality since QMS is mandatory for the certified organization
        Improvement of customer satisfaction, higher chance to retain repeat customers
        Better process integration
            Easier to find improvements in efficiency and cost savings
            Drive efficiencies towards fewer errors
        Improve evidence for decision making
            Focused on applying resources to areas that improves efficiencies and increases cost savings with less trial and error to find the right decision
            Ability to visualize how much improvement has happened
        Create continual improvement culture
        Engagement of employees
            Employees who are engaged in continuous improvement projects are happier and more engaged
            Engaged employees are more productive

            Company values
            Company culture
            ICT infrastructure
            Available resources
        Note: QMS of a pharmaceutical company is more complicated than the QMS of a small family run businesses

    Clause 4.2: Understanding the needs and expectations of interested parties
        Determine the interested parties that are significant for achievement of the quality objectives
        Determine the requirements of the interested parties regarding the QMS
        Different groups have different requirements regarding the QMS
            Example one client may be more important than the other
        See the bigger picture and understand the needs of your company
        Once the requirements are known, start configuring QMS according to you requirements
        Required to be conducted but not requried to be documented
        Create a list of interested parties and their requirements
        Interested Parties
            Partners

            Promote continual improvement of the QMS
                Enable employees to propose improvement (Suggestion box, dedicated email, organize brainstorming session for QMS improvement, etc)
        Crucial for the success of QMS
        Without leadership, implementation of QMS would certainly fail
            QMS can't function without top management complying to the rules
        Requires top management and leaders to demonstrate leadership and commitment but not required to document on how it will be done

    Clause 5.2: Quality Policy

        For small companies, usually 1 person i.e Quality Manager or Quality Assurance Manager. In some cases, Quality Engineer
        For large size companies, 
            one person responsible for implementing and the other for reporting OR
            one person for implementing and reporting a segment of QMS (i.e Quality Performance), the other person reports the production process, Design and development, etc
        The standard does not explicitly requires for the roles and responsibilities to be documented. 
        If documented, roles have to be communicated in organizational chart, policies, procedures, plans and other documents the is being developed during implementation of ISO9001
        
    Clause 6.1: Addressing Risks and Opportunities
        Determine risks and opportunities regarding its QMS and its ability to achieve intended results
        Risks and opportunities to be considered are the ones emerging from the internal and external context of the organization and requirements of interested parties

                Risks emerging from external contexts can be the change in local legislation or actions of competitors
                Risks emerging from internal contexts can be the obsolete quipment that increase the number of nonconforming products
        Purpose is to 
            Ensure that QMS will provide the intended results and to prevent and reduce undesired effects
            Enhance the desirable effects and achieve improvements
        The company will decide what risks and opportunities are significant 
        Activities include:
            Avoiding the risk
            Taking the risks
            Eliminating the risk source
            Changing the likelihood and consequences
            Sharing the risks
            Retaining the risk
            Review the actions regarding risks and opportunities (done during management review)
        ISO9001 does not require organizations to 
            Establish full risk management
            Create procedures and records
        What to document and up to which level depends on the context (Organization size and complexity)
