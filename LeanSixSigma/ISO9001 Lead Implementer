    Quality management Principles
        Used to enhance company performance and achieve success
        7 Principles:
            Customer Focus
                To meet customer requirements and strive to exceed expectations
            Leadership
                Leaders at all levels establish unity of purpose and direction
                People are engaged in achieving the quality objectives
            People engagement
                It is essential that people are competent, empowered and engaged in delivering value
            Process Approach
                Predictable and consistent results are achieved more effectively when activities are understood and managed as interrelated processes
            Improvement
                Successful organization has ongoing focus on improvement
            Evidence based decision making
                Decisions based on analysis and evaluation of data and information are more likely to produce desired result
            Relationship management
                For sustained success, organization manage their relationship with interested parties such as suppliers
    
    Quality Management System   
        Is a systematic approach for quality management and for enhancing customer satisfaction
        QMS is a set of policies, procedures and instructions that sets internal rule that governs the company on how to create and deliver product or services to customers
            Explain to employees what the best practice is in order to determine the needs and expectations of the customers,
            Establish control of processes to ensure that employees deliver what can be expected from them
        The quality management controls are not only technical, but they can be a combination of both types of controls
            Organizational Control - Documentation of procedures
            Engineering Control - Implementation of new technologies
            HR Related Control - Training of People
        Quality: The level of fulfillment of customer expectations

    Implementation requirements
        ISO9001 specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing and maintaining the QMS
        Standards to be implemented and maintained through PDCA cycle
        Plan
            What to do and how to do it
            Understanding the context of the organization
            Define Scope, Quality Policy, Risks and Opportunities, quality objectives and control of processes
        Do 
            Implementation of the plan defined in Plan Phase
            Fulfilling QMS requirements
            Achieve quality objectives
            Implement control of processes
        Check
            Confirm that thing run as planned
            Check all objectives are achieved
            Regular monitoring and measuring
            Internal audits and management reviews
        Act            
            Improving the way things being done
            Implement corrective actions and improvement intiatives

    Implementing ISO9001 as a project
        Form a team and assign them to concrete roles
        Roles:
            Project Manager
                Person that coordinates project for the implementation of ISO9001
            Project Team 
                Any person under coordination of PM will be included in documenting and implementing the process controls
                Assist to organize and give advices on the changes made
            Management Representative
                Responsible for maintaining QMS and its continual improvement
                Often this person is the project manager
            Top Management
                Responsible to support the process by showing commitment, setting objectives, making decisions and
                provide relevant resources by assigning the right people to dedicate time for implementation process
                Dedicate budget and other resources

    Documenting ISO9001 requirements
        QMS consists of set of policies, procedures and other controls that set rules
        What to document and to what level of details
            Check whether a document is required/mandatory by ISO9001
                Example: Results of Management review are mandatory to be documented
                The organization shall retain documented information of 
                    Quality Policy
                    Quality objectives and plans to achieve them
                    Records of training, skills, experience and qualifications
                    Criteria for evaluation and selection of suppliers
                    Monitoring and measuring equipment, calibration records
                    Product/service requirements review records
                    Records about design and development outputs review, inputs, controls, change records
                    Characteristics of product to be produced and service to be provided
                    Records about customer property
                    Production/service provision change control records
                    Records of conformity of product/service with acceptance criteria
                    Records of nonconforming outputs
                    Monitoring and measurement results
                    Internal audit program
                    Results of internal audits
                    Results of management review
                    Results of corrective actions
                    NOTE: 
                        Not every process needs a documented procedure
                        But useful to have additional policies and procedures documented
            Criteria for non-mandatory document
                Size of company
                    Smaller companies tend to have fewer documents so avoid writing a procedure for every small process
                    Makes more sense for MNCs with 10k employees to write policies where each have related procedures and every procedure has working instructions
                Importance and complexity
                    The more important and complex a process or activity is, the more likely you have to write the policy or procedure to describe it
                    This is to make sure everyone understands how to perform a process or activity to avoid breakdowns in the operations
                ISO9001 does not specify what kind of document is required for operating the QMS, it's up to the organization to document in a way it finds most appropriate
                Amount of documentation depends on the size and complexity of the products and services
    
    Benefits of ISO9001
        Improves credibility and image, ability to achieve higher quality since QMS is mandatory for the certified organization
        Improvement of customer satisfaction, higher chance to retain repeat customers
        Better process integration
            Easier to find improvements in efficiency and cost savings
            Drive efficiencies towards fewer errors
        Improve evidence for decision making
            Focused on applying resources to areas that improves efficiencies and increases cost savings with less trial and error to find the right decision
            Ability to visualize how much improvement has happened
        Create continual improvement culture
        Engagement of employees
            Employees who are engaged in continuous improvement projects are happier and more engaged
            Engaged employees are more productive

            Company values
            Company culture
            ICT infrastructure
            Available resources
        Note: QMS of a pharmaceutical company is more complicated than the QMS of a small family run businesses

    Clause 4.2: Understanding the needs and expectations of interested parties
        Determine the interested parties that are significant for achievement of the quality objectives
        Determine the requirements of the interested parties regarding the QMS
        Different groups have different requirements regarding the QMS
            Example one client may be more important than the other
        See the bigger picture and understand the needs of your company
        Once the requirements are known, start configuring QMS according to you requirements
        Required to be conducted but not requried to be documented
        Create a list of interested parties and their requirements
        Interested Parties
            Partners

                Enable employees to propose improvement (Suggestion box, dedicated email, organize brainstorming session for QMS improvement, etc)
        Crucial for the success of QMS
        Without leadership, implementation of QMS would certainly fail
            QMS can't function without top management complying to the rules
        Requires top management and leaders to demonstrate leadership and commitment but not required to document on how it will be done

    Clause 5.2: Quality Policy

        For small companies, usually 1 person i.e Quality Manager or Quality Assurance Manager. In some cases, Quality Engineer
        For large size companies, 
            one person responsible for implementing and the other for reporting OR
            one person for implementing and reporting a segment of QMS (i.e Quality Performance), the other person reports the production process, Design and development, etc
        The standard does not explicitly requires for the roles and responsibilities to be documented. 
        If documented, roles have to be communicated in organizational chart, policies, procedures, plans and other documents the is being developed during implementation of ISO9001
        
    Clause 6.1: Addressing Risks and Opportunities
        Determine risks and opportunities regarding its QMS and its ability to achieve intended results
        Risks and opportunities to be considered are the ones emerging from the internal and external context of the organization and requirements of interested parties

                Risks emerging from internal contexts can be the obsolete quipment that increase the number of nonconforming products
        Purpose is to 
            Ensure that QMS will provide the intended results and to prevent and reduce undesired effects
            Enhance the desirable effects and achieve improvements

            Changing the likelihood and consequences
            Sharing the risks
            Retaining the risk
            Review the actions regarding risks and opportunities (done during management review)
        ISO9001 does not require organizations to 
            Establish full risk management
            Create procedures and records
        What to document and up to which level depends on the context (Organization size and complexity)

    Clause 6.2: Quality Objectives
        Represent the basis for continual improvement of the QMS
        Defines the priorities in Quality management
        Things to consider when defining the quality objectives
            Aligned with the Quality Policy
            Easy to measure in order to be able to monitor the progress of the achievement

                Relevant to conformity of product and services
                Enhance customer satisfaction
            Objectives should be updated to reflect the current state in the company and its QMS
            Create plan to achieve the objectives by 
                Assigning responsible person, 
                Allocating resources,
                Define deadline for completion, etc
        ISO9001 requires the objectives to be documented
        MUST Contain:
            Description (The target objective for the following year)
            Measurable target: Decrease by %
            Target Time Frame: 1 year
            Example: Decrease the number of defects by 10% by next year
        During the check phase, the effectiveness of the QMS will be measured

    Clause 7.1: Resources

        Knowledge: Maintained through updated work instructions, procedures, training, etc
        Monitoring: Measuring equipment must be calibrated and verified
        Infrastructure: Building, equipment, transportation, communication, information
        ISO9001 does not require resources to be documented, but usually documented through budget, human resource plan, quality objectives

    Clause 7.2: Competence

            Define training needs,
            Documenting training plan, etc

    Clause 7.3: Awareness
        Everybody in the company are required to demonstrate awareness of 
            Quality policy, 
            Quality objectives, 
            Their own contributions to the effectiveness of QMS,
            The implications of not conforming to the QMS requirements
        The employees are required to know what they are suppose to do and why

    Clause 7.5: Documented Information
        How documented information should be created, updated and controlled
        2 Types of Information
            Information that guides how processes are conducted, i.e procedures

        Examples of documents:
            Procedures
            Policies
            Plans
        Example of Records:
            Emails,
            Paper forms,
            Records in database,
            Logs in measuring devices,
        When creating and updating, the company should ensure:
            Appropriate identification and description, ie title, date, author, etc
            Appropriate media and format used for documenting
        Documented information must be controlled to ensure availability, protected from loss of confidentiality, integrity or improper use
        To be able to control, company needs to consider:

    Clause 8.1: Operational Planning and Control
        Requires establishment of criteria/acceptance, resource needs, process controls, documented information
        Without proper planning and control, company cannot ensure its processes delivers intended results
        The requirements for products and services must be determined 
            What exactly we want to produce
            How our service should look like
        Usually done in the document called "Product" or "Service Specification"
        Once the organization knows what characteristics its product or service should have, it needs to determine the criteria for the processes
            Company needs to prescribe the way how its processes are carried out
            And what values some parameters must have during the process
        Example: A Bakery, The bakery produces 1 type of bread with defined recipe without any new products
            Purchasing of ingredients or raw materials
                Job of bakery owner
                Warehousing process where worker stores other ingredients
            Production Process
                The baker is responsible
            Distribution Process
                Driver is responsible to deliver the bread
            Determine resources needed to ensure that the product or services will be delivered as intended
                Human resources,
                Facilities,
                Equipment,
                Raw Materials
            Define 
                How many bakers it needs, 
                How many ovens and what type of ovens
                How much flour and other ingredients, etc
            Implement controls of the processes according to the criteria
                Temperature of the oven
                Monitoring of the oven and how frequent
            Determine what procedures and records will be kept and to what extent
                To ensure that the processes will be carried out as planned
                To demonstrate the conformity of the products to their requirements
                Work Instruction: 
                    Recipe on how the bread is made
                    Ingredients at required temperature (Records of at what temperature yeast being stored before production, etc)
            Planning of processes and controls must result with the outputs that are suitable to organization's operations
                Drawings, 
                Controls,
                Procedures,
                Defined clear rules and instructions for all operations, validation and verification activities

    Clause 8.3a: Design and Development (Planning and Inputs)
        Creates competitive advantage for the organization
        Enables it to adapt its products and services to changing needs and expectations of its customers
        
        Step 1: Planning 
            Determine the phases/stages and controls during design and development
                Start project > Phase 1 > Phase 2 > Validation > End Project
            Consider the various aspects of 
                The nature, duration and complexities of activities
                Required process stages and reviews
        Step 2: Required process stages and reviews
            The stages mu be defined as well as the points where the review will be conducted
        Step 3: Validation and verification activities
            Validation: Computer simulation to ensure the product is able to meet the requirement
            Verification: Inspections on first prototype
        Step 4: Resources
            What facility and software is needed

        ISO9001 does not require this clause to be documented but it is common to document
        Usually documented in Project Plan or Project Tasks
        Organization must determine all inputs needed for successful design and development
        Incomplete inputs can lead design and development process to faillure (Customer poorly define requirements)

        Defining the inputs
            Function and performance requirements of the product and service to be defined
                How the product should look like
                What materials will be used, etc
            Information from previous similar activities
                Company may use some parts from previous design to save time
            Applicable statutory and regulatory requirements
                Strict rules around the materials used in production of toys
            Potential consequences of failure due to nature of product and services
                Risks in design process must be identified, 
                What can go wrong
                What are the potential consequences of the design process failure

        Factors to have effective design and development process:
            Inputs must be adequate, complete and clear
            Inputs must be well expressed and defined
            Input will help the company to precisely plan the design process and save time
            Poorly defined inputs will definitely result in constant changes, increased time and money spent for the design
            Any conflicting design and development input must be resolved before continuing

        ISO9001 require Inputs to be documented usually in the Project Task

    Clause 8.3b: Design and Development (Controls, Outputs and Changes)
        Controls
            Includes regular reviews to evaluate the results of the design and development 
            Determine if they meet input requirements
            At the end of each phase of the design and development, the manager or member can do a review
            Validation and verification should be conducted at some phase of design and development
            If there's nonconformity, activities should be taken to resolve the problems, and records of the activities should be retained

        Output
            Outputs must be adequate for the subsequent processes for the provision of products and services
            Outputs must include or reference to monitoring and measuring requirements
            Must clearly state what phases of production require monitoring and measuring, or what equipment should be used
            Outputs must specify key characteristics of the products and services regarding their intended purpose
            All key characteristics must be stated in Product or Service specification
            All necessary information for the customer should be defined (ie instruction manual)
            Must be documented in Design Review Minutes or some other similar document

        Changes
            Changes made should be identified, reviewed and controlled to prevent adverse effects on conformity to input requirements
            Design team needs to clearly know what is expected from them if changes being made
            To review the changes in order to determine the viability 
            Records of the review and authorization of changes must be kept
            

    Clause 8.4: Control of Externally Provided Processses, Products and Services
        Requires all outsourced operations to be identified and appropriately controlled to ensure products and services conforms to the requirements of organization
        Important because outsourced operations are also critical to customer satisfaction
        Examples: Customer support, call centres, transportation, production processes
        Ensure that the hired company follows the requirements for product
        Ensure that propduction process is carried out as required and relevant work instruction is being followed
        Controls of the outsource company:
            Determine the type and extent of the controls needed to ensure the outsourced company will be able to deliver required product
            Communicating the requirements and controls with the outsourcing company
            Getting the acceptance of the outsource company
            Written rules will help the outsource company to meet requirements and will them more opportunity to manage and control outsourcing operations
        Things to consider when defining controls for outsourced processes:
            Control can vary from limited to no influence especially if that company is a large corporation or overseas
            Some products or services may be excluded from outsourcing
        Control of outsourced processes should be documented "To the extent necessary to achieve confidence that the process is carried out as planned"
        Up to your company to write the procedure, guidance or some other document

    Clause 8.5: Control of production and service provision
        Organization must conduct the controls of production under controlled conditions
        
        Controlled conditions are:
            Documents that define characteristics of the products and services (ie Product or Service Specification)
            Documents about the activities to be performed (ie Procedure for Production, Service Provision, Work Instruction)
            Monitoring and Measuring activities to be implemented at appropriate stages in the process to ensure process is conducted according to plan 
            To have necessary resources such as measuring equipment, suitable infrastructure and competent people
            Ensure that planned results of production and services can be achieved by occasional validation and re-validation activities
            Validation will be conducted where the conformity of the product cannot be verified after production or the cost of verification is too high
            The production and service provision process should be organized in a way that minimizes the chance of human error
            Implement release, delivery, post-delivery activities
            Demonstrate the released product is conforming to the requirements through product release records
            
        Whenever necessary, the organization needs to establish traceability of its product (Track down product from raw materials to every processes to delivery to customers)
            Important especially when it is neeeded to stop the problematic process line that is nonconforming without recalling all finished goods
        Standard requires property to be identified, verified and protected
        When property is lost or damaged, company must report to the owner and document what has happened in notification to a customer about changes on his property
        Changes must be reviewed on how the faulty equipment affect the conformance or the product or service
        Exclusion of this activity will create more uncertainty and the final product will meet input requirements
        Up to the company to decide whether or not to take the risk or not

    Clause 8.6: Post Production Activities
        Influences the conformity of products, services and customer satisfaction
        Activities include:
            Preserving the outputs during production and service provision
                Ensure they conform to the requirements
            Determine the post-delivery activities
                Ensure statutory and regulatory requirements are adhered
                Potential undesired consequences associated with the product/service 
                Nature, Use and intended lifetime of products and service (ie expiration date)
                Customer requirements and feedback (ie warranty, after sales support)
            The products need to be verified to demonstrate that it meets product requirements
                Prior to delivery, sample of the product will be taken by customer to be tested to determine if it meets the requirements
                If requirement does not meet, product cannot be delivered to the customer
                    Exclusion of this can be made if relevant authorities approves the release
            Documents required prior to the release
                Evidence of conformity to acceptance criteria (ie lab results, inspection report, traceability to person authorizing the release)

    Clause 8.7: Control of Non-Conforming Outputs
        Difference between Clause 8.7 and Clause 10.2 
            10.2 is about how to resolve the problem
            8.7 is about how non conforming product should be handled before initiating the corrective action
        Non-conforming output must be identified and controlled in order to prevent them from reaching the customer
            This is to prevent penalties, lawsuit and dissatisfaction by customers
        Actions to address nonconformities must be appropriate to the nature of the nonconformance and its effects on product/services
        Actions taken on nonconforming products
            Correction - nonconformance can be removed by simple correction
                Verification of the corrected product is conforming to the original requirements
            Segregation, containment, return or suspension of provision
                In the case of food storage not complying to the required temperature
                The batch must be separated and delivery must be stopped for that affected batch
                Affected batch to be sent for analysis
            Informing the customer
                Determine if it is necessary to inform the customer about nonconforming output
                If the company discovers the nonconformance it will jeopardize the delivery
            Obtaining authorization for acceptance under concession
                In some cases, delivery of nonconforming products can be allowed by the customer
                Customer must provide authorization prior to delivery
                Usually happens when the nonconformance product deviation is to small when compared to the original requirements
        ISO9001 requires companies to keep records that describe nonconformity and actions taken to remove them
            Usually done in "Record of Nonconformity" and contains the name of authority deciding on the actions taken in respect to the nonconformance

    Clause 8: Operating the QMS
        After obtaining QMS Certification, QMS must be operated on daily basis
        This represents a real compliance to ISO9001 and the only way to benefit from the implementation
        Ensure to:
            Perform all the activities described in the Quality Policy and Procedures
            All processes must be conducted as defined in the related procedure
            If the procedure did not make the production process work, then simplify or delete some documents that are not mandatory
        In the case of changing of company circumstances (new products/process/technology)
            Update the policies and procedures otherwise, these documents will become useless
            The best practice is to nominate an owner of each document and that person will have to review the document periodically

    Clause 9.1: Monitoring, measurement, analysis and evaluation
        Implementing monitoring and measurement activities is to verify that the criteria for control of processes and outputs are met
            In hydraulic press production, you need to monitor the pressure of the presses, and,
            When the product is finished, you need to measure the dimensions to see whether the requirements are met
        Monitoring refers to reviewing and observing
            Monitoring customer satisfaction refers to reviewing the results of measuring the customer satisfaction
        Measuring refers to determining the size or amount of something by concrete values
            Measuring customer satisfaction refers to obtaining the information from the customer
        Analysis refers to examining the result of measuring
            Analyzing customer satisfaction refers to comparing results of customer satisfaction from previous survey and current survey
        The company needs to:
            Identify what needs to be monitored and measured (ie parameters of process, number of complaints)
            Identify methods for monitoring, measuring, analyze and evaluation (ie generate reports for monitoring) 
            Determine the frequency of the measurement (ie data captured quarterly for analysis)
            Have a person to be responsible for conducting, monitoring and measure (ie production manager, )
            Determine when the results will be analyzed and evaluated and who will be responsible
        ISO9001 requires organizations to monitor customer satisfaction
            Establish the methods for obtaining, monitoring and reviewing the information about the customer satisfaction
            Can be done through surveys, feedbacks, meetings, etc
            Information about customer satisfaction is the most valuable inputs in management review
        ISO9001 requires the results from the monitoring and measuring are documented as evidence
        ISO9001 does not define what needs to be monitored and measured
        For large corporations, the best practise is to have the process documented as a procedure
        For smaller companies, QA manager is responsible for monitoring and measuring 
        Time schedules, frequencies, tools, and methods to be written in the procedure
        The results from monitoring and measuring is one of the main input for the QMS

    Clause 9.2: Internal Audit
