    Quality management Principles
        Used to enhance company performance and achieve success
        7 Principles:
            Customer Focus
                To meet customer requirements and strive to exceed expectations
            Leadership
                Leaders at all levels establish unity of purpose and direction
                People are engaged in achieving the quality objectives
            People engagement
                It is essential that people are competent, empowered and engaged in delivering value
            Process Approach
                Predictable and consistent results are achieved more effectively when activities are understood and managed as interrelated processes
            Improvement
                Successful organization has ongoing focus on improvement
            Evidence based decision making
                Decisions based on analysis and evaluation of data and information are more likely to produce desired result
            Relationship management
                For sustained success, organization manage their relationship with interested parties such as suppliers
    
    Quality Management System   
        Is a systematic approach for quality management and for enhancing customer satisfaction
        QMS is a set of policies, procedures and instructions that sets internal rule that governs the company on how to create and deliver product or services to customers
            Explain to employees what the best practice is in order to determine the needs and expectations of the customers,
            Establish control of processes to ensure that employees deliver what can be expected from them
        The quality management controls are not only technical, but they can be a combination of both types of controls
            Organizational Control - Documentation of procedures
            Engineering Control - Implementation of new technologies
            HR Related Control - Training of People
        Quality: The level of fulfillment of customer expectations

    Implementation requirements
        ISO9001 specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing and maintaining the QMS
        Standards to be implemented and maintained through PDCA cycle
        Plan
            What to do and how to do it
            Understanding the context of the organization
            Define Scope, Quality Policy, Risks and Opportunities, quality objectives and control of processes
        Do 
            Implementation of the plan defined in Plan Phase
            Fulfilling QMS requirements
            Achieve quality objectives
            Implement control of processes
        Check
            Confirm that thing run as planned
            Check all objectives are achieved
            Regular monitoring and measuring
            Internal audits and management reviews
        Act            
            Improving the way things being done
            Implement corrective actions and improvement intiatives

    Implementing ISO9001 as a project
        Form a team and assign them to concrete roles
        Roles:
            Project Manager
                Person that coordinates project for the implementation of ISO9001
            Project Team 
                Any person under coordination of PM will be included in documenting and implementing the process controls
                Assist to organize and give advices on the changes made
            Management Representative
                Responsible for maintaining QMS and its continual improvement
                Often this person is the project manager
            Top Management
                Responsible to support the process by showing commitment, setting objectives, making decisions and
                provide relevant resources by assigning the right people to dedicate time for implementation process
                Dedicate budget and other resources

    Documenting ISO9001 requirements
        QMS consists of set of policies, procedures and other controls that set rules
        What to document and to what level of details
            Check whether a document is required/mandatory by ISO9001
                Example: Results of Management review are mandatory to be documented
                The organization shall retain documented information of 
                    Quality Policy
                    Quality objectives and plans to achieve them
                    Records of training, skills, experience and qualifications
                    Criteria for evaluation and selection of suppliers
                    Monitoring and measuring equipment, calibration records
                    Product/service requirements review records
                    Records about design and development outputs review, inputs, controls, change records
                    Characteristics of product to be produced and service to be provided
                    Records about customer property
                    Production/service provision change control records
                    Records of conformity of product/service with acceptance criteria
                    Records of nonconforming outputs
                    Monitoring and measurement results
                    Internal audit program
                    Results of internal audits
                    Results of management review
                    Results of corrective actions
                    NOTE: 
                        Not every process needs a documented procedure
                        But useful to have additional policies and procedures documented
            Criteria for non-mandatory document
                Size of company
                    Smaller companies tend to have fewer documents so avoid writing a procedure for every small process
                    Makes more sense for MNCs with 10k employees to write policies where each have related procedures and every procedure has working instructions
                Importance and complexity
                    The more important and complex a process or activity is, the more likely you have to write the policy or procedure to describe it
                    This is to make sure everyone understands how to perform a process or activity to avoid breakdowns in the operations
                ISO9001 does not specify what kind of document is required for operating the QMS, it's up to the organization to document in a way it finds most appropriate
                Amount of documentation depends on the size and complexity of the products and services
    
    Benefits of ISO9001
        Improves credibility and image, ability to achieve higher quality since QMS is mandatory for the certified organization
        Improvement of customer satisfaction, higher chance to retain repeat customers
        Better process integration
            Easier to find improvements in efficiency and cost savings
            Drive efficiencies towards fewer errors
        Improve evidence for decision making
            Focused on applying resources to areas that improves efficiencies and increases cost savings with less trial and error to find the right decision
            Ability to visualize how much improvement has happened
        Create continual improvement culture
        Engagement of employees
            Employees who are engaged in continuous improvement projects are happier and more engaged
            Engaged employees are more productive

            Company values
            Company culture
            ICT infrastructure
            Available resources
        Note: QMS of a pharmaceutical company is more complicated than the QMS of a small family run businesses

    Clause 4.2: Understanding the needs and expectations of interested parties
        Determine the interested parties that are significant for achievement of the quality objectives
        Determine the requirements of the interested parties regarding the QMS
        Different groups have different requirements regarding the QMS
            Example one client may be more important than the other
        See the bigger picture and understand the needs of your company
        Once the requirements are known, start configuring QMS according to you requirements
        Required to be conducted but not requried to be documented
        Create a list of interested parties and their requirements
        Interested Parties
            Partners

                Enable employees to propose improvement (Suggestion box, dedicated email, organize brainstorming session for QMS improvement, etc)
        Crucial for the success of QMS
        Without leadership, implementation of QMS would certainly fail
            QMS can't function without top management complying to the rules
        Requires top management and leaders to demonstrate leadership and commitment but not required to document on how it will be done

    Clause 5.2: Quality Policy

        For small companies, usually 1 person i.e Quality Manager or Quality Assurance Manager. In some cases, Quality Engineer
        For large size companies, 
            one person responsible for implementing and the other for reporting OR
            one person for implementing and reporting a segment of QMS (i.e Quality Performance), the other person reports the production process, Design and development, etc
        The standard does not explicitly requires for the roles and responsibilities to be documented. 
        If documented, roles have to be communicated in organizational chart, policies, procedures, plans and other documents the is being developed during implementation of ISO9001
        
    Clause 6.1: Addressing Risks and Opportunities
        Determine risks and opportunities regarding its QMS and its ability to achieve intended results
        Risks and opportunities to be considered are the ones emerging from the internal and external context of the organization and requirements of interested parties

                Risks emerging from internal contexts can be the obsolete quipment that increase the number of nonconforming products
        Purpose is to 
            Ensure that QMS will provide the intended results and to prevent and reduce undesired effects
            Enhance the desirable effects and achieve improvements

            Changing the likelihood and consequences
            Sharing the risks
            Retaining the risk
            Review the actions regarding risks and opportunities (done during management review)
        ISO9001 does not require organizations to 
            Establish full risk management
            Create procedures and records
        What to document and up to which level depends on the context (Organization size and complexity)

    Clause 6.2: Quality Objectives
        Represent the basis for continual improvement of the QMS
        Defines the priorities in Quality management
        Things to consider when defining the quality objectives
            Aligned with the Quality Policy
            Easy to measure in order to be able to monitor the progress of the achievement

                Relevant to conformity of product and services
                Enhance customer satisfaction
            Objectives should be updated to reflect the current state in the company and its QMS
            Create plan to achieve the objectives by 
                Assigning responsible person, 
                Allocating resources,
                Define deadline for completion, etc
        ISO9001 requires the objectives to be documented
        MUST Contain:
            Description (The target objective for the following year)
            Measurable target: Decrease by %
            Target Time Frame: 1 year
            Example: Decrease the number of defects by 10% by next year
        During the check phase, the effectiveness of the QMS will be measured

    Clause 7.1: Resources

        Knowledge: Maintained through updated work instructions, procedures, training, etc
        Monitoring: Measuring equipment must be calibrated and verified
        Infrastructure: Building, equipment, transportation, communication, information
        ISO9001 does not require resources to be documented, but usually documented through budget, human resource plan, quality objectives

    Clause 7.2: Competence

            Define training needs,
            Documenting training plan, etc

    Clause 7.3: Awareness
        Everybody in the company are required to demonstrate awareness of 
            Quality policy, 
            Quality objectives, 
            Their own contributions to the effectiveness of QMS,
            The implications of not conforming to the QMS requirements
        The employees are required to know what they are suppose to do and why

    Clause 7.5: Documented Information
        How documented information should be created, updated and controlled
        2 Types of Information
            Information that guides how processes are conducted, i.e procedures

        Examples of documents:
            Procedures
            Policies
            Plans
        Example of Records:
            Emails,
            Paper forms,
            Records in database,
            Logs in measuring devices,
        When creating and updating, the company should ensure:
            Appropriate identification and description, ie title, date, author, etc
            Appropriate media and format used for documenting
        Documented information must be controlled to ensure availability, protected from loss of confidentiality, integrity or improper use
        To be able to control, company needs to consider:

    Clause 8.1: Operational Planning and Control
        Requires establishment of criteria/acceptance, resource needs, process controls, documented information
        Without proper planning and control, company cannot ensure its processes delivers intended results
        The requirements for products and services must be determined 
            What exactly we want to produce
            How our service should look like
        Usually done in the document called "Product" or "Service Specification"
        Once the organization knows what characteristics its product or service should have, it needs to determine the criteria for the processes
            Company needs to prescribe the way how its processes are carried out
            And what values some parameters must have during the process
        Example: A Bakery, The bakery produces 1 type of bread with defined recipe without any new products
            Purchasing of ingredients or raw materials
                Job of bakery owner
                Warehousing process where worker stores other ingredients
            Production Process
                The baker is responsible
            Distribution Process
                Driver is responsible to deliver the bread
            Determine resources needed to ensure that the product or services will be delivered as intended
                Human resources,
                Facilities,
                Equipment,
                Raw Materials
            Define 
                How many bakers it needs, 
                How many ovens and what type of ovens
                How much flour and other ingredients, etc
            Implement controls of the processes according to the criteria
                Temperature of the oven
                Monitoring of the oven and how frequent
            Determine what procedures and records will be kept and to what extent
                To ensure that the processes will be carried out as planned
                To demonstrate the conformity of the products to their requirements
                Work Instruction: 
                    Recipe on how the bread is made
                    Ingredients at required temperature (Records of at what temperature yeast being stored before production, etc)
            Planning of processes and controls must result with the outputs that are suitable to organization's operations
                Drawings, 
                Controls,
                Procedures,
                Defined clear rules and instructions for all operations, validation and verification activities

    Clause 8.3a: Design and Development (Planning and Inputs)
        Creates competitive advantage for the organization
        Enables it to adapt its products and services to changing needs and expectations of its customers
        
        Step 1: Planning 
            Determine the phases/stages and controls during design and development
                Start project > Phase 1 > Phase 2 > Validation > End Project
            Consider the various aspects of 
                The nature, duration and complexities of activities
                Required process stages and reviews
        Step 2: Required process stages and reviews
            The stages mu be defined as well as the points where the review will be conducted
        Step 3: Validation and verification activities
            Validation: Computer simulation to ensure the product is able to meet the requirement
            Verification: Inspections on first prototype
        Step 4: Resources
            What facility and software is needed

        ISO9001 does not require this clause to be documented but it is common to document
        Usually documented in Project Plan or Project Tasks
        Organization must determine all inputs needed for successful design and development
        Incomplete inputs can lead design and development process to faillure (Customer poorly define requirements)

        Defining the inputs
            Function and performance requirements of the product and service to be defined
                How the product should look like
                What materials will be used, etc
            Information from previous similar activities
                Company may use some parts from previous design to save time
            Applicable statutory and regulatory requirements
                Strict rules around the materials used in production of toys
            Potential consequences of failure due to nature of product and services
                Risks in design process must be identified, 
                What can go wrong
                What are the potential consequences of the design process failure

        Factors to have effective design and development process:
            Inputs must be adequate, complete and clear
            Inputs must be well expressed and defined
            Input will help the company to precisely plan the design process and save time
            Poorly defined inputs will definitely result in constant changes, increased time and money spent for the design
            Any conflicting design and development input must be resolved before continuing

        ISO9001 require Inputs to be documented usually in the Project Task

    Clause 8.3b: Design and Development (Controls, Outputs and Changes)
        Controls
            Includes regular reviews to evaluate the results of the design and development 
            Determine if they meet input requirements
            At the end of each phase of the design and development, the manager or member can do a review
            Validation and verification should be conducted at some phase of design and development
            If there's nonconformity, activities should be taken to resolve the problems, and records of the activities should be retained

        Output
            Outputs must be adequate for the subsequent processes for the provision of products and services
            Outputs must include or reference to monitoring and measuring requirements
            Must clearly state what phases of production require monitoring and measuring, or what equipment should be used
            Outputs must specify key characteristics of the products and services regarding their intended purpose
            All key characteristics must be stated in Product or Service specification
            All necessary information for the customer should be defined (ie instruction manual)
            Must be documented in Design Review Minutes or some other similar document

        Changes
            Changes made should be identified, reviewed and controlled to prevent adverse effects on conformity to input requirements
            Design team needs to clearly know what is expected from them if changes being made
            To review the changes in order to determine the viability 
            Records of the review and authorization of changes must be kept
            

    Clause 8.4: Control of Externally Provided Processses, Products and Services
        Requires all outsourced operations to be identified and appropriately controlled to ensure products and services conforms to the requirements of organization
        Important because outsourced operations are also critical to customer satisfaction
        Examples: Customer support, call centres, transportation, production processes
        Ensure that the hired company follows the requirements for product
        Ensure that propduction process is carried out as required and relevant work instruction is being followed
        Controls of the outsource company:
            Determine the type and extent of the controls needed to ensure the outsourced company will be able to deliver required product
            Communicating the requirements and controls with the outsourcing company
            Getting the acceptance of the outsource company
            Written rules will help the outsource company to meet requirements and will them more opportunity to manage and control outsourcing operations
        Things to consider when defining controls for outsourced processes:
            Control can vary from limited to no influence especially if that company is a large corporation or overseas
            Some products or services may be excluded from outsourcing
        Control of outsourced processes should be documented "To the extent necessary to achieve confidence that the process is carried out as planned"
        Up to your company to write the procedure, guidance or some other document

    Clause 8.5: Control of production and service provision
        Organization must conduct the controls of production under controlled conditions
        
        Controlled conditions are:
            Documents that define characteristics of the products and services (ie Product or Service Specification)
            Documents about the activities to be performed (ie Procedure for Production, Service Provision, Work Instruction)
            Monitoring and Measuring activities to be implemented at appropriate stages in the process to ensure process is conducted according to plan 
            To have necessary resources such as measuring equipment, suitable infrastructure and competent people
            Ensure that planned results of production and services can be achieved by occasional validation and re-validation activities
            Validation will be conducted where the conformity of the product cannot be verified after production or the cost of verification is too high
            The production and service provision process should be organized in a way that minimizes the chance of human error
            Implement release, delivery, post-delivery activities
            Demonstrate the released product is conforming to the requirements through product release records
            
        Whenever necessary, the organization needs to establish traceability of its product (Track down product from raw materials to every processes to delivery to customers)
            Important especially when it is neeeded to stop the problematic process line that is nonconforming without recalling all finished goods
        Standard requires property to be identified, verified and protected
        When property is lost or damaged, company must report to the owner and document what has happened in notification to a customer about changes on his property
        Changes must be reviewed on how the faulty equipment affect the conformance or the product or service
        Exclusion of this activity will create more uncertainty and the final product will meet input requirements
        Up to the company to decide whether or not to take the risk or not

    Clause 8.6: Post Production Activities
        Influences the conformity of products, services and customer satisfaction
        Activities include:
            Preserving the outputs during production and service provision
                Ensure they conform to the requirements
            Determine the post-delivery activities
                Ensure statutory and regulatory requirements are adhered
                Potential undesired consequences associated with the product/service 
                Nature, Use and intended lifetime of products and service (ie expiration date)
                Customer requirements and feedback (ie warranty, after sales support)
            The products need to be verified to demonstrate that it meets product requirements
                Prior to delivery, sample of the product will be taken by customer to be tested to determine if it meets the requirements
                If requirement does not meet, product cannot be delivered to the customer
                    Exclusion of this can be made if relevant authorities approves the release
            Documents required prior to the release
                Evidence of conformity to acceptance criteria (ie lab results, inspection report, traceability to person authorizing the release)

    Clause 8.7: Control of Non-Conforming Outputs
        Difference between Clause 8.7 and Clause 10.2 
            10.2 is about how to resolve the problem
            8.7 is about how non conforming product should be handled before initiating the corrective action
        Non-conforming output must be identified and controlled in order to prevent them from reaching the customer
            This is to prevent penalties, lawsuit and dissatisfaction by customers
        Actions to address nonconformities must be appropriate to the nature of the nonconformance and its effects on product/services
        Actions taken on nonconforming products
            Correction - nonconformance can be removed by simple correction
                Verification of the corrected product is conforming to the original requirements
            Segregation, containment, return or suspension of provision
                In the case of food storage not complying to the required temperature
                The batch must be separated and delivery must be stopped for that affected batch
                Affected batch to be sent for analysis
            Informing the customer
                Determine if it is necessary to inform the customer about nonconforming output
                If the company discovers the nonconformance it will jeopardize the delivery
            Obtaining authorization for acceptance under concession
                In some cases, delivery of nonconforming products can be allowed by the customer
                Customer must provide authorization prior to delivery
                Usually happens when the nonconformance product deviation is to small when compared to the original requirements
        ISO9001 requires companies to keep records that describe nonconformity and actions taken to remove them
            Usually done in "Record of Nonconformity" and contains the name of authority deciding on the actions taken in respect to the nonconformance

    Clause 8: Operating the QMS
        After obtaining QMS Certification, QMS must be operated on daily basis
        This represents a real compliance to ISO9001 and the only way to benefit from the implementation
        Ensure to:
            Perform all the activities described in the Quality Policy and Procedures
            All processes must be conducted as defined in the related procedure
            If the procedure did not make the production process work, then simplify or delete some documents that are not mandatory
        In the case of changing of company circumstances (new products/process/technology)
            Update the policies and procedures otherwise, these documents will become useless
            The best practice is to nominate an owner of each document and that person will have to review the document periodically

    Documents
        Sales Procedure
            To describe all activities related to the sales process, from recording the customer’s requests to delivery of product and service.
        Procedure for Design and Development

    Clause 9.1: Monitoring, measurement, analysis and evaluation
        Implementing monitoring and measurement activities is to verify that the criteria for control of processes and outputs are met
            In hydraulic press production, you need to monitor the pressure of the presses, and,
            When the product is finished, you need to measure the dimensions to see whether the requirements are met
        Monitoring refers to reviewing and observing
            Monitoring customer satisfaction refers to reviewing the results of measuring the customer satisfaction
        Measuring refers to determining the size or amount of something by concrete values
            Measuring customer satisfaction refers to obtaining the information from the customer
        Analysis refers to examining the result of measuring
            Analyzing customer satisfaction refers to comparing results of customer satisfaction from previous survey and current survey
        The company needs to:
            Identify what needs to be monitored and measured (ie parameters of process, number of complaints)
            Identify methods for monitoring, measuring, analyze and evaluation (ie generate reports for monitoring) 
            Determine the frequency of the measurement (ie data captured quarterly for analysis)
            Have a person to be responsible for conducting, monitoring and measure (ie production manager, )
            Determine when the results will be analyzed and evaluated and who will be responsible
        ISO9001 requires organizations to monitor customer satisfaction
            Establish the methods for obtaining, monitoring and reviewing the information about the customer satisfaction
            Can be done through surveys, feedbacks, meetings, etc
            Information about customer satisfaction is the most valuable inputs in management review
        ISO9001 requires the results from the monitoring and measuring are documented as evidence
        ISO9001 does not define what needs to be monitored and measured
        For large corporations, the best practise is to have the process documented as a procedure
        For smaller companies, QA manager is responsible for monitoring and measuring 
        Time schedules, frequencies, tools, and methods to be written in the procedure
        The results from monitoring and measuring is one of the main input for the QMS

    Clause 9.2: Internal Audit
        Purpose of internal audit is to provide information if the QMS is fulfilling the requirements of the company for quality management and the requirements of ISO9001
        Without internal audit, the company wouldn't have a systematic and objective overview on what is really happening to the QMS
        ISO9001 requires organizations to establish the internal audit program which is an annual schedule of internal audits
        Determine the scope of audit:
            Which processes and department will be audited
            For large companies, some of the process will be audited in June and the rest in September
            For small companies, whole company will be included in the internal audit scope
        Scope of audit has to be documented through the audit programme
        Before starting the audit, determine the audit criteria against which the audit will be performed
            This can be the ISO9001 standards itself (ie legal requirements, contractual oligations, or requirements of interested parties)
        The company must select the auditors to conduct the audit
            The most important thing here is to avoid conflict of interest (ie having finance manager to audit the finance department)
            The auditor must also be familiar with the ISO9001 standard, 
            The auditor must be familiar with the auditing techniques which is usually achieved by sending the auditor to internal auditor course
        Creating the plan for internal audit
            The plan is not mandatory to be documented but documenting the plan is useful to avoid missing anything out throughout the audit process
            Documenting the plan makes communication about the audit to relevant people much easier
        Defining the Audit Plan
            Determine the amount of time you will spend in each process or department, 
            Determine the people and roles to be interviewed
            Determine who will conduct the audit (Audit can be conducted by an auditor or a team of auditors)
            Results must be presented to the top management in a form of documented internal audit report
            The report includes general observations of the auditor, spotted nonconformites, good practices and recommendations
            
    Clause 9.3: Management Review        
        Purpose of management review is for top management to review the QMS at planned intervals to ensure it is suitable, adequate and effective
        Management does not have to define the operational controls but must know what is going on in the QMS
        Management must take some crucial decisions 
        ISO9001 requires the top management to review:
            Condition of actions from previous management review
                Example if the last review was the decision to train 3 more auditors, the top management should check if this was implemented and what are the results
            Changes in external and internal issues relevant to the QMS
            Changes in needs and expectations of interested parties
            Performance of exernal providers
                Analyze whether the supplier delivers what was expected and whether there is a need for additional control of the supplier
            Effectiveness of actions taken to address risks and opportunities
            Level of achievement of the quality objectives
                When the objectives are met, management should introduce new ones or of higher standards
                If objectives arent met, the mangement must initiate corrective actions to determine the root cause and to ensure the objectives will be met in the future
            Information on process performance includes: 
                The nonconformities and corrective actions, 
                Monitoring and measurement results, 
                Conformity of products and services, 
                Audit results and adequacy of resources
            Opportunities for improvement of the QMS
                Based on customer feedback, the company may decide to improve its customer support process
        The best practice is to conduct the QMS Review through a meeting at least once a year (The more often, the better)
        ISO9001 requires the company to document the results from the review as evidence
        After the meeting, the outputs will be documented in "Management Review Minutes of Meeting" or "Management Review Report"
        Mandatory outputs includes:
            Opportunities for improvement (Raising the standards)
            Decisions related to the changes of the QMS
                The company decides to outsource some processes and then establish new controls for the outsourced process
            Resources needs
                During the quality objectives analysis, the management may conclude some objectives havent been met because of the lack of resources
                In the new plans to achieve the objectives, additional resources will be appointed

    Clause 10.1: Nonconformities and Corrective Actions
        Nonconformity is when a certain requirement doesn't comply with either:
            ISO9001 standards
            Relevant legislations,
            QMS documentations,
            Requirements of interested parties
        This clause enables companies to identify and effectively deal with oversights, errors, mistakes, etc
        NTOE: A customer complaint is not automatically a nonconformity; the cause of the complaint must be determined and then investigated to see if it was caused by a nonconformity or something else.
        Nonconformance can be identified by anyone at any time
        Usually nonconformities are identified during internal audit
        Corrective Actions mean a formal way for a company to resolve nonconformity
        ISO9001 requires companies to keep records as evidence of the nature of nonconformance, the actions that were taken, and the results of the implemented corrective actions
        The record is called "The Corrective Action Form"
        Corrective action isn't enough. The company should really resolve the root cause of nonconformity
            The results and the effect should be evaluated
        Correction and Corrective Action are not the same thing
            Correction: Removal of the consequences
            Corrective Action: Removal of the cause of nonconformity
        Good practise to document the procedure for nonconformities and corrective actions
        The procedure should: 
            Define the steps for analysing the nonconformities, 
            Initiating corrective actions, 
            Assigning responsibilities for corrective actions,
            How to document and evaluate the effectiveness of the corrective actions, etc
        ISO9001 requires companies to take the following actions when nonconformities occur:
            Correct and Control the nonconformity and deal with the consequences,
                In the event where the company is not conducting the internal audit appropriately (using untrained auditors), the company should deal with the risks, consequences and train the internal auditors
            Evaluate the need to eliminate the cause of nonconformity to prevent reoccurence by: 
                Reviewing and determining the cause
                Identifying if similar nonconformities exists
                Make sure that this nonconformity will not happen again in the future    
            Implement relevant actions
                Conduct new audit with newly trained auditors
            Review the effectiveness of the corrective actions
                Check if the new conducted audits were performed by trained auditors
            Make changes to the QMS if needed
                Document internal audit procedure (although not required by the standad),
                Explain the responsibiliies of the person in charge 
                The requirements for having trained internal auditor

    Clause 10.2: Continual Improvement
        The standard requires that the company continually improve the suitability, the adequacy, and the effectiveness of QMS 
        Everythihng changes and this has significant influences to the QMS, the risk and opportunities, customer satisfaction, market conditions, etc
        The ISO standard changes as well
        The QMS should change to reflect the changing of business, environment and threats 
        The new opportunities changes as well
        The improvement opportunities vary depending on the type of company and the maturity of the QMS
        Examples of improvement initiatives:
            Implement software tools to support the process control activities,
            Document new procedure,
            Introduce new modalities of awareness, etc
        All improvements require changes in the QMS but not every changes bring improvement
            
    Documents:
        Matrix of Key Performance Indicators 
            The listing of the important factors that the company has chosen to track to ensure maintenance of the processes.

    Identifying your present Situation
        1. Are you working on an organization that assigns you as the person responsible for implementing the management system and taking it to certification audit
        2. Do you believe that the implementation of the management system and certification will be beneficial? Would like to initiate a project with the top management
        3. Do you want to start working as a consultant and get in touch with the top management that are considering implementing the management system and get them certified
        
        If you are in Situation 1, Skip Module 5 altogether and go for the next Module (6) "Prepare for the implementation"
        If you are in Situation 2, Skip " Get more sales meetings with prospects" and go for "How to get the interest of top management in the project"
        If you are the consultant, read all

    For Consultants: Get more sales meetings with Prospects
        One must get more meetings with sales prospects to  increase the probability of closing a deal
        Things to consider:
            Before contacting prospects and asking for a meeting to present your services, start by preparing them for your call.
            If they do not know who you are and what you do, they are not going to talk, let alone meet.
            You should create an organized prospecting campaign
            Identify target customers and prepare ways of showing them who you are and what you do
            Use emails, newsletters or blogs
            Publish articled in technical magazines or professional networks
            If you speak to 50 or 100 potential customers , they'll start seeing you as an expert in your field
            You should develop this  possibility by nurturing your network
            You can ask someone you know to introduce you to someone they know from their network of contacts
            You should write, share what you know and share your experience and results, share testimonies from your customers about the outcomes of working with you
            Use blogs, professional networks and trade magazines

    Getting interest of top management in your project
        Convince top management that implementing a management system and certifying it is beneficial
        Things the management only understands
            Profit
            Market Share
            Client Satisfaction
            Cost Reduction
            Business Startegy
            Business Risk
        If you want them to listen to you, speak the language they understand
        They will only understand if you present them with business benefit of implementing and certifying
        Potential Benefits
            Improvement of credibility and image
            There are customers that require management system certification from their suppliers
            The certification is a business market on its own and to get into this market requires certification (This will generate additional revenues)
            Cutting business maintenance cost (Cost of customer's audits due to project penalties VS Cost of annual ISO9001 audit)
            Improvement of customer satisfaction
            Better process integration (Department not working well with another department - can be observed from internal meetings)
            Improve evidence for decision making
                Changes take longer than anticipated causing a cost overrun/lost of production
            Create continual improvement culture
            Engagement of employees (High turnover rate due to lack of employee engagement) - Save on training of new employees

    How to present the project
        As Internal consultant: 
            Sell yourself as a reliable partner
            Show them the importance of a management system to help the organization achieve its goals
        As External consultant: 
            Introduce yourself
            Give them your experience and what your contributions can be
            Tell them what you do and how can you help them
            What kind of outcomes you can help them achieve
            Emphasize what others will get from you
        
        Pre-Meeting:
            Look for the information about the organization 
                What it does, 
                Their situation, 
                Their clients,
                Their business sector,
                Any challenges that lie ahead
            Focus on what you can offer, but what the customer will get
            
            Things to consider:
                Why are they looking for help now, at this time?
                    Your services is an instrument for them.
                    They need help to meet some goal or get through some difficulties
                Why You and why would they contact you in particular?
                Why they think your services will help them?
             
        During Meeting:
            Ask your customer what they want to achieve
            How will they measure the success of the project
            When do they want to start?
            When they expect completion?
            What resources they expect to allocate the project
            What will come next after the meeting?
            
        Follow Up
            After meeting, send them a brief email to thank them
            Use this occasion to send a summary of the items discussed
            Send your business proposal
            
        Don't expect top management to grasp all the benefits after the 20 minutes meeting
        It will take time for the management to understand

    Other Techniques for presenting the project
        Elevator Speech
            Prepare an elevator speech (30 to 60 seconds speech to present your case) - Rehearse to sound confident and convincing
        Find an "Ally" (Someone with influence over top management)
            Find people who are close to the CEO and who would naturally be interested in what you are doing (CFO might be able to see the savings potential)

    Writing a great proposal
        The proposal is not meant to win a deal. The deal supposed to be won before sending the proposal
        Proposal needs to be focused on the customer's desired outcomes
        State what the client is going to get, what they can expect and how it will benefit their business
        Clarify the conditions - State the resource the customers wants to channel to the development of the project        
        Set milestones to the project (See Project Management)        
        Onboarding overview
            Day 1: Meet the team
            Day 2: Training
            Day 3: Training
            Day 4: Meet the executives
            Day 5: Onboarding ends
        Pricing:
            State price
            How and when payment will be made
            Invoices, Taxes, Expenses, etc
        Keep the proposal short (Longer proposal provide no extra value)
            
        Follow ups after sending the proposal

    Define the scope of the projects
        Establish the borders where the management system will apply
        What parts of the organization will be included
        What kind of products, services, markets, will be considered
        For big corporations, they have a choice to include or exclude other facilities based on location and products 
        Know the budget, requirements of the standard, legal requirements, intention of top management and the current state of the organization
        May choose to perform Gap Analysis and this allows you to find out what part of the management system the organization already has in place
        Gap Analysis is a tool to identify the gapbetween what the organization does and what is required for a compliant management system

    Key stages of the project
        PDCA Cycle: Plan Do Check Act
            Plan what you intend to do (includes setting the objectives)
            Do/Implement what you planned for
            Check whether your implementation has achieved the intended results
            Act: Fill the gap between what you achieved and what you planned for in the first place
        Plan Phase:
            Set the scope, objectives, top level, policy and structure, risk management, 
        Do Phase:
            What processes should be implemented in order to achieve the objective set in plan phase
            Execution of top level policy
        Check Phase:
            Different level of performance evaluation through monitoring and measurement 
            Internal audits and management review
        Act Phase:
            Handle nonconformities
            Develop corrective actions
            Promote continual improvement

    Tips for project management
        List all the activities required to implement the management system based of PDCA cycle and Gap Analysis
        Identify the resources of the organization, time constraint, and eventual deadlines required by the organization
        Prioritize activites and define the pace of project development
        Translate activities and pace to a calendar
        Who needs to do the activities and by when it needs to be done
        Include a list of control points to the calendar
        Check if the plan is being followed and is under control
        Any management actions must be taken to restore or improve the control of the activities
        Control what is being done and the degree to which it is being implemented and followed
        Monitor the effectiveness
        Include final verification point to go all over the preparation points since the start

        Monitoring:
            Activities being scheduled in a calendar doesn't mean that the progress of the work will be followed as planned
            Include control points to check the progress of the project
            Evaluate the need for project review
            Check the available resources
            Review pace
            Review people
            Check the quality of the work done
            Check on any difficulties (ie resistance from employees)
            Determine important milestones and include control points for each one
                Policy awareness
                Procedure implementation
                Performance monitoring
                Management review

    Estimating the project
        Consider all the activities and amount of effort required to complete the work 
        Consider if the work can be broken down to a team
        Consider the time requirements from the organization
            <50 employees: Less than 8 months 
            50 to 500 employees: 8 to 12 months
            >500 employees: 12 to 15 months
        Estimate the workload of a consultant/expert
        Consider the size of the team and the team's capacity, experience, authority and availability
        Consider how much time this project can be delivered taking note of the duration requirements
        Work shouldn't be limited by the project manager but by the organization itself

    Communication
        Communicate the purpose of the project:
            Importance of the project
            How anyone can participate and help with the implementation
        A project is a temporary organization and communication is the glue that hold everything together
        Poor communication is a major source of conflict and slippages
        Consider:
            Who needs to know
            What they need to know
            How much they need to know
            How often must they be informed
        Effective monitoring and tracking of the project is dependant on good communication between the team members and key stake holders
        Prompt feedback of:
            Current progress of the active tasks
            Problems encountered with the work
            Problems anticipated with work to be done
            Technical difficulties being encountered
        Key stakeholders expects regular status reports
        Status reports:
            What has been completed
            What has not been completed and why
            What is being done about the incomplete work
            What problems remains unsolved
            What needs to be done about the unsolved problems
            What difficulties are anticipated in the work waiting to be dones
        Communication maximizes understanding
        Creates confidence and minimizes risks
        Consider which activities must be done in parallel
        Consider which activities must be completed before others can start
        Allocate reponsibiliities
        Each key stages of project needs to be owned by one of the team members

    Use of Tools
        Types of Tools
            Project Management or collaboration tool (Communication, cut down on emails, speed up change control)
            Tools to draw flowcharts (to reduce time generating flowchart)
            Skype (virtual meeting)
            Tools to help monitor organizational performance (Using dashboards instead of tables)
            Legislation software (Using electronic services that monitor and informs changes in legislation or standards relevant to scope of management system)
            Tools for writing documentation (Documentation templates, tutorials)
        
        Pros and Cons of Automation tools
            Automation tools eliminates time-consuming activities like using spreadsheets for risk assessment
            Assists you to handle the whole project by suggesting the steps to be takes, who is responsible for what, which documents to be produced and who should approve
            Most of automation tools are made for large corporations
            Tools are not cheap
            Too many features and employee training for their use are too time consuming
            Consider ease of use and pricing before using such tool

        Documentation tools (Templates)
            Speeds up writing of policies and procedures
            Tips on how to choose the right one
                Consider company size the templates were designed for
                The kind of help received for using the documents/templates (Guidelines, tutorials, support)
                Experience level of the authors (Best to have template were authored by Consultant and auditors)

    Roles and Responsibilities
        Project Sponsor 
            Someone who does not actively participate in the project
            Must be regularly briefed by project manager about project status and intervene if project is halted
            Useful for unlocking resources and reconcile conflicting priorities and escalated issues
        Project Manager
            Ensure the resources necessary for project implementation
            Coordinate the project
            Inform the sponsor about progress
            Carry out administrative work related to the project

            Make decisions about various issues that requires multidisciplinary approach
            Always meets before the final version of a document is completed or whenever necessary
            Identification of each participant, roles and responsibilities has to be included in the project plan
            Include how they have access to information about the project 
            Include how communication about the project will flow to them

    Project Manager's Risks
        Impacts project timeline, performance and budget
        Risks are potential things that can happen
        Risk management is a process of determining, categorizing, prioritizing and planning for risks before they occur
        Managing risk shouldn't be reactive
        Should be part of planning process to determine risks that might happen and how it can be controlled
        Examples of risks:
            Top management disregarding project communications and meetings
            Required activities are missing from the initial scope definition
            Inaccurate estimates of time or cost
            Resources shortfall or inexperienced staff
            Data protection and confidentiality issues
        Anticipate risks throughout the project lifecycle

    Project Documentation   
        Project work produces large amount of data and it is important to record essential material
        Useful to go back and check history of project
        Setup a project file for all the documentation related to the project
        The project file will give the project manager a complete control over the project by being the best source of knowledge
        Organize project file into folders for different stages of the project
            Project plan and schedules (To update members of deadlines, plans and changes)
            Concerns about time slippage should not be a last minute issue
        Project execution
            Records of how the project progressed has to be kept (What was delivered and how the implementation was planned and verified)
        Agendas and records of work meetings
        Project deliverables
            Development versions, approved versions, 
        Implementation plan including the project monitoring and control activities
        Project control
            Keep evidence of the project being monitored and controlled
            When conflicts and misunderstanding appears, important to keep evidence of what happened
            When all apects of the proect are stated, it leaves little room for argument
        Project status reports
        Agendas and records of control meetings
        Project closure
        Certification
            After deciding that the implementation phase has ended, top management should decide if certification is the next step
        NOTE: People tend to blame project managers (lawsuits or other complications) when anything goes wrong, project documentation is to protect the project manager

    Write a project plan
