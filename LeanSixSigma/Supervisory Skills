01. Proven Supervisory Model - Getting the work done through the efforts of others

    Excellent relationship is the cornerstone behind a good supervisor and it's not the technical expertise 
    It is about finding the balance between organization goals and the needs of the team
        Organization goals:
            Productivity
            Quality
            Cost
            Regulations, etc
        Needs of the Team
            Training
            Time offs
            Conflict resolution, etc

    Guiding the Work
        A supervisor's view of work must be broader than the view of the employees
        Effective supervisors must be able to guide the team towards the business goals in such a way the team members know their needs are not being ignored
        Guiding the work involves taking the directional goals of the organization and translating it into actionable plans for the team
        Fostering the environment where the employees are encouraged to collaborate and feel empowered to develop creative solutions to solve complex problems
        Failure to empower employees will lead to decreased performance and therefore increased turnover

        Scenario:
            A project your team received 3 weeks ago seems stalled even when the team knows it's important.
            Decide to have a talk with the group about what the problem is
            How do supervisors start the discussion?
            
            A. Tell the group you need to know what is going on with the project and tell them you will accept whatever changes they suggest
            B. Start by stating clearly that this project must be completed. Discuss team's expectation and the business expectations
            C. Tell the group that the project is now a top priority and give them a completion date

            Answer: B
            Why?
                Clear expectations from start
                Discussion includes team commitment

        Dos & Donts

        Skill improvement tips
            Make it clear to the team the you support the organization and its goals
            Provide direction even when in unfamiliar areas
            Balance asking for information and acting decisively
            Plan in advance - what, who and how included in the work plan
            Create specific and realistic plans - Plans are tools that translates intentions into actions
            Gain commitment by actively involving your team - Without commitment shown by the team, the action plan will fall apart
