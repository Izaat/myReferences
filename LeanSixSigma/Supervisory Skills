01. Proven Supervisory Model - Getting the work done through the efforts of others

    Excellent relationship is the cornerstone behind a good supervisor and it's not the technical expertise 
    It is about finding the balance between organization goals and the needs of the team
        Organization goals:
            Productivity
            Quality
            Cost
            Regulations, etc
        Needs of the Team
            Training
            Time offs
            Conflict resolution, etc

    Guiding the Work
        A supervisor's view of work must be broader than the view of the employees
        Effective supervisors must be able to guide the team towards the business goals in such a way the team members know their needs are not being ignored
        Guiding the work involves taking the directional goals of the organization and translating it into actionable plans for the team
        Fostering the environment where the employees are encouraged to collaborate and feel empowered to develop creative solutions to solve complex problems
        Failure to empower employees will lead to decreased performance and therefore increased turnover

        Scenario:
            A project your team received 3 weeks ago seems stalled even when the team knows it's important.
            Decide to have a talk with the group about what the problem is
            How do supervisors start the discussion?
            
            A. Tell the group you need to know what is going on with the project and tell them you will accept whatever changes they suggest
            B. Start by stating clearly that this project must be completed. Discuss team's expectation and the business expectations
            C. Tell the group that the project is now a top priority and give them a completion date

            Answer: B
            Why?
                Clear expectations from start
                Discussion includes team commitment

        Dos & Donts
            Understand the needs of the organization and plan the team's work effectively to meet those needs

        Skill improvement tips
            Make it clear to the team the you support the organization and its goals
            Provide direction even when in unfamiliar areas
            Balance asking for information and acting decisively
            Plan in advance - what, who and how included in the work plan
            Create specific and realistic plans - Plans are tools that translates intentions into actions
            Gain commitment by actively involving your team - Without commitment shown by the team, the action plan will fall apart

    ////////////////////////////
    Organizing the work
        Assigning the right task to the right people
        Providing resources to meet work goals
        As businesses going through tranformation to stay competitive, it will be often to cinsistently reorganize the work
        The change itself produces opportunities and costs associated with it
        
        Scenario:
            You appointed one of your team member as project leader, but it is clear that another employee is really seen as the leader by the group.
            The project is progressing well, but it worries you that the leadership is not where you want it to be.
            What would you do?
            A. Make it clear to the team who the leader is and who you support. Don't tolerate other sources of leadership
            B. Appoint a leader who has the group's support as the formal project leader.
            C. Dont interfere
            
            Answer: C
            Why?
                Informal leadership in most cases is not harmful
                The true appointed leader is the supervisor (you)
                The leadership you appoint is an informal leadership
            
        Work within hierarchy is critical but supervisors need the awareness of the unspoken hierarchy aka "informal organization"
        Informal organizations have strong impact on the organization of work
        Informal organizations also often exceed the effectiveness of some prearranged cross functional teams
        When it is inline with the formal organization, the supervisors should simply let them be
        Supervisors fighting the informal organization is often can be fruitless work
        Supervisors should intervene only when the informal organization is working against the formal hierarchy
        Therefore, the need to intervene will be less frequent if a culture of transparency, trust and teamwork is encouraged in the department

        Dos & Donts
            Assign people and allocate resources to accomplish work goals
            As supervisor, know and understand what motivates your employee 
            Be sensitive to their needs, actively listen and seek their feedback
            Organizing work efficiently often requires the assistance of people and who may be more knowledgable in that particular area
            
            |                     Dos                            |                       Donts                           |  
            | Set the schedules to meet the organization's goals | Accept work changes without question                  |
            | Use other's expertise to organize when necessary   | Show favoritism or fail to delegate unpleasant tasks  |
            | Keep track of what's going on in informal org.     | Fail to assign responsibility for necessary tasks     |
            | Involve others if you have to reorganize           | Try to have complete knowledge of all aspects of work |
            
        Skill improvement tips

            Consult employees to gain complete knowledge of the work
            Follow the rules, regulations and guidelines of the organization
            Accommodate the needs of your work group when they are not in direct conflict with the organization's needs

    Developing Staffs
        Developing staffs involves knowing and actively working to increase the skill level of each employee being supervised
        Supervisor who are aware of the unique skillsets of the individual team members will be best equipped to help team members meet the team's potential

        Scenario:
            You believe that one of the people you supervise has the potential to be promoted, but that person lacks confidence in his or her abilities.
            How would you build his or her confidence?
            A. Give the employee a challenging assignment that you are sure he/she can complete with some effort
            B. Give the employee an easy assignment and then praise him/her when the assignment is completed
            C. Praise the employee publicly each time he/she completes an assignment

            Answer: A
            Why?
                Creates more engagement
                Greater self-esteem on completion
            
        Investing in an employee's development takes commitment, trust, well defined objective, clearly defined action plan and follow through by both the supervisor and the employee           
        Delegating work to employees creates more engagement and builds the skill base for organizing 
        Delegating also frees the supervisor to develop his/her own skills
        Company's morale will be boosted if the supervisor assigns tasks perceived as challenging, engaging and aligned to the employees interest

        Dos & Donts
            Increase the skill level of each employee by learning his/her strengths and assign tasks according to the development need
            Start by organizing the task and choose an employee who is willing and able to develop the skill to complete the task
            As supervisor, you automatically become a teacher/coach/mentor            
            
            |                Dos                                          |                    Donts                                            |   
            | Delegate work that develops employee's skills               | Complete tasks yourself because they require effort to teach others |
            | Know the employee on an individual basis                    | Treat employees as a group rather than as individuals               |
            | Keep employees informed about their status/requests         | Forget to tell employees about the status/requests                  |
            | Make your expectation results clear when you delegate tasks | Delegate only to people who already have the skill for the task     |

        Skill improvement tips
            Take time to delegate - Supervisors who refuse to delegate are robbing your direct reports of an oppurtunity to perform
            Delegate work that develops employees skills and does not require your formal authority
            Delegate to employees who need development and are willing to be developed
            Provide clear expectations and follow up regularly
            Set challenging and realistic goals for the workgroup
