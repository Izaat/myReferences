01. Proven Supervisory Model - Getting the work done through the efforts of others

    Excellent relationship is the cornerstone behind a good supervisor and it's not the technical expertise 
    It is about finding the balance between organization goals and the needs of the team
        Organization goals:
            Productivity
            Quality
            Cost
            Regulations, etc
        Needs of the Team
            Training
            Time offs
            Conflict resolution, etc

    Guiding work
    Organizing Work    
    Developing Staff
    Managing Relations
    Managing Performance

    ////////////////////////////
    Guiding the Work
        A supervisor's view of work must be broader than the view of the employees
        Effective supervisors must be able to guide the team towards the business goals in such a way the team members know their needs are not being ignored
        Guiding the work involves taking the directional goals of the organization and translating it into actionable plans for the team
        Fostering the environment where the employees are encouraged to collaborate and feel empowered to develop creative solutions to solve complex problems
        Failure to empower employees will lead to decreased performance and therefore increased turnover

        Scenario:
            A project your team received 3 weeks ago seems stalled even when the team knows it's important.
            Decide to have a talk with the group about what the problem is
            How do supervisors start the discussion?
            
            A. Tell the group you need to know what is going on with the project and tell them you will accept whatever changes they suggest
            B. Start by stating clearly that this project must be completed. Discuss team's expectation and the business expectations
            C. Tell the group that the project is now a top priority and give them a completion date

            Answer: B
            Why?
                Clear expectations from start
                Discussion includes team commitment

        Dos & Donts
            Understand the needs of the organization and plan the team's work effectively to meet those needs

        Skill improvement tips
            Make it clear to the team the you support the organization and its goals
            Provide direction even when in unfamiliar areas
            Balance asking for information and acting decisively
            Plan in advance - what, who and how included in the work plan
            Create specific and realistic plans - Plans are tools that translates intentions into actions
            Gain commitment by actively involving your team - Without commitment shown by the team, the action plan will fall apart

    ////////////////////////////
    Organizing the work
        Assigning the right task to the right people
        Providing resources to meet work goals
        As businesses going through tranformation to stay competitive, it will be often to cinsistently reorganize the work
        The change itself produces opportunities and costs associated with it
        
        Scenario:
            You appointed one of your team member as project leader, but it is clear that another employee is really seen as the leader by the group.
            The project is progressing well, but it worries you that the leadership is not where you want it to be.
            What would you do?
            A. Make it clear to the team who the leader is and who you support. Don't tolerate other sources of leadership
            B. Appoint a leader who has the group's support as the formal project leader.
            C. Dont interfere
            
            Answer: C
            Why?
                Informal leadership in most cases is not harmful
                The true appointed leader is the supervisor (you)
                The leadership you appoint is an informal leadership
            
        Work within hierarchy is critical but supervisors need the awareness of the unspoken hierarchy aka "informal organization"
        Informal organizations have strong impact on the organization of work
        Informal organizations also often exceed the effectiveness of some prearranged cross functional teams
        When it is inline with the formal organization, the supervisors should simply let them be
        Supervisors fighting the informal organization is often can be fruitless work
        Supervisors should intervene only when the informal organization is working against the formal hierarchy
        Therefore, the need to intervene will be less frequent if a culture of transparency, trust and teamwork is encouraged in the department

        Dos & Donts
            Assign people and allocate resources to accomplish work goals
            As supervisor, know and understand what motivates your employee 
            Be sensitive to their needs, actively listen and seek their feedback
            Organizing work efficiently often requires the assistance of people and who may be more knowledgable in that particular area
            
            |                     Dos                            |                       Donts                           |  
            | Set the schedules to meet the organization's goals | Accept work changes without question                  |
            | Use other's expertise to organize when necessary   | Show favoritism or fail to delegate unpleasant tasks  |
            | Keep track of what's going on in informal org.     | Fail to assign responsibility for necessary tasks     |
            | Involve others if you have to reorganize           | Try to have complete knowledge of all aspects of work |
            
        Skill improvement tips
            Handle shifting priorities
            Quickly investigate unforeseen problems and solve them
            Consult employees to gain complete knowledge of the work
            Follow the rules, regulations and guidelines of the organization
            Accommodate the needs of your work group when they are not in direct conflict with the organization's needs

    ////////////////////////////
    Developing Staffs
        Developing staffs involves knowing and actively working to increase the skill level of each employee being supervised
        Supervisor who are aware of the unique skillsets of the individual team members will be best equipped to help team members meet the team's potential

        Scenario:
            You believe that one of the people you supervise has the potential to be promoted, but that person lacks confidence in his or her abilities.
            How would you build his or her confidence?
            A. Give the employee a challenging assignment that you are sure he/she can complete with some effort
            B. Give the employee an easy assignment and then praise him/her when the assignment is completed
            C. Praise the employee publicly each time he/she completes an assignment

            Answer: A
            Why?
                Creates more engagement
                Greater self-esteem on completion
            
        Investing in an employee's development takes commitment, trust, well defined objective, clearly defined action plan and follow through by both the supervisor and the employee           
        Delegating work to employees creates more engagement and builds the skill base for organizing 
        Delegating also frees the supervisor to develop his/her own skills
        Company's morale will be boosted if the supervisor assigns tasks perceived as challenging, engaging and aligned to the employees interest

        Dos & Donts
            Increase the skill level of each employee by learning his/her strengths and assign tasks according to the development need
            Start by organizing the task and choose an employee who is willing and able to develop the skill to complete the task
            As supervisor, you automatically become a teacher/coach/mentor            
            
            |                Dos                                          |                    Donts                                            |   
            | Delegate work that develops employee's skills               | Complete tasks yourself because they require effort to teach others |
            | Know the employee on an individual basis                    | Treat employees as a group rather than as individuals               |
            | Keep employees informed about their status/requests         | Forget to tell employees about the status/requests                  |
            | Make your expectation results clear when you delegate tasks | Delegate only to people who already have the skill for the task     |

        Skill improvement tips
            Take time to delegate - Supervisors who refuse to delegate are robbing your direct reports of an oppurtunity to perform
            Delegate work that develops employees skills and does not require your formal authority
            Delegate to employees who need development and are willing to be developed
            Provide clear expectations and follow up regularly
            Set challenging and realistic goals for the workgroup

    ////////////////////////////
    Managing Performance
        Removing obstacles to improve performance so employees can meet their own objectives as well as organization's objectives
        Obstacles to employee performance can be found both within the employee (confidence, ability, skills, etc) and the work environment (time, resources, etc)
        As supervisor, be mindful of the obstacles and should be able to manage them, by knowing every employee's current skillsets and the expected performance, and closing the gap between both
        Large part of managing performance involves the continual coaching of direct report to achieve their potential 
        It also invovles understanding the career goals of the direct report
            i.e Looking into the future and decide what level of performance can reasonably expected of the empmloyee   
        Beyond teaching how to perform, supervisors should strive to instill them a level of self confidence in their ability to perform
        Another aspect of managing performance is dealing with performance problems
            The best approach in managing issues is to maintain fair reasoning and aligning them to the organization's expectations

        Scenario:
            One of your employees is always just a little late completing his/her assigned tasks. 
            It hasn't really affected the work, but it annoys others
            What would you do?
            A. Schedule a formal performance review meeting with the employee and document it
            B. Tell others in your group to work around it. It is only a minor problem
            C. Have a short informal meeting in which you tell this person about the impact of the problem and discuss solutions
            
            Answer: C 
            Why?  
                Coaching is more effective than a formal review
                Help employee gain awareness of actions
                

        Dos & Donts
            Track the performance of your employees and help them meet their own objectives and those of the organization
            
            |                               Dos                           |                          Donts                                     |              
            | Track performance and provide feedback on a continual basis | Review performance only once a year                                |
            | Judge performance by how it affects the organizatoin        | Judge employees before you talk with them about teir performance   |
            | Remain objective                                            | Allow yourself to become emotional                                 |
            | Get commitment frm employees to imprve their performance    | Try to fix every problem, no matter how small                      |

        Skill Improvement Tips:
            Perform these steps on an ongoing basis with the employees
                1. Tell what you expect of them (Informal one on one sessions)
                2. Monitor their progress and provide feedback (Systematic)
                3. Formally evaluate their performance (Annual reviews)
            Provide suggested actions to improve employee performance
            Address performance problems as soon as they occur (Do not let it snowball into something bigger)
            Learn to distinguish between problems that need formal attention and those that do not
            Confront 'behid the scene' problems when they affect performance

    ////////////////////////////
    Managing relations
        Developing and maintaining good relationship with other groups so that your direct reports and the organization can meet the goals
        Relationships:
            With organization
            With direct report
            With vendors
            With HR
            With technical experts
            With regulatory bodies
            With Internal and External customers
            etc
        Nowadays, organizations become more connected internally and externally 
        The ability to manage relationships with other department has become a key skill for supervisors as there have been cross functional teams working together in many organizations
        Managing relationships should be guided by the goals of the organization by putting everyone on the common ground, providing basis for decision making
        When interfacing with other departments, real cooperation is not a matter of getting along, but it also takes into account the constraints and goals of other departments
        It is working together really making sure that what they're trying to accomplish aligns with what your department is trying to accomplish, as well as exchanging resources
        Communication is key to maintaining good relationship
        
        Scenario:
            You have been blindsided quite a few times recently by changes in the organization that you didn't know about but other supervisors did know.
            Your group is starting to get upset.
            What would you do?
            A. Ask your boss to keep you better informed about what is happening
            B. Make an effort to get to know other supervisors and talk to them about what is happening
            C. You'll never know everything. Teach your people how to react quickly to unexpected things.
            
            Answer: B
            Why?
                Other supervisors are a good source of information and support
        
        Dos & Donts
            Work closely with others to ensure that your work group is effective and the organization's goals are met
            
            |                         Dos                                |                               Donts                                     |        
            | Keep other groups informed about your plans                | Try to acquire resources by complaining about your group's situation    |
            | Consider others' requests for help based on needs of org   | Try to have complete knowledge of other group's work                    |
            | Become familiar with other groups' work                    | Turn down all requests for help that gives inconveniences to your group |
            | Develop relationships with other supervisors               | Accept work from other group without question                           |

        Skill Improvement Tips:
            View other workgroups as partners
            Acquire resources by framing requests according to what is good for the organization, rather than your work group
            Know how and when to ask for support from other work groups
            Respond to requests from other work groups by understanding the organization's goals
            Network with other supervisors for help and information

03. How to identify a Supervisor's Strengths and Weaknesses

    Develop strengths of effective supervisors by assessing and identifying the following:
        What they do well
        How they need to be developed (Coaching/Mentoring/Training)
        Where are the performance gaps (Online supervisory assessment tools available)

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   
04. 5 Types of Leadership
    
    Get things done by leading others to success
    Leaders choose their styles based on the circumstances and the end goal
    
    1. Structural
    2. Participative
    3. Servant
    4. Freedom
    5. Transformational
    
    Structural
        Everyone knows exactly 
           What needs to be done
           Why it needs to be done
           The standards upon completion
        This style allows the leader to make quick decision without the input or challenge from the others
        It allows more transactional activities to occur (ie reward, punish members based on their performance on the leader's predetermined goal)
        Use this style ONLY when the team is already motivated and are experts who need little direction
        Since there is not much room for flexibility, using this style too much can lead them to feel overwhelmed especially when the morale is low
        Innovation will be stifled when morale is low
        
    Participative
        The leader puts the team first and this makes the team feel they were cared for.
        The friendship factor which is part of this style is composed of 3 components (Time, Caring, Respect)
            Care and concern (Fosters the feeling of bonding, belonging and ownership)
            Patience and understanding
        This style boosts team's morale by allowing them to participate in reaching a consensus of decisions and goals
        The team opinions and voices feel heard which will help them buy into changes easily
        This also will help the leader to obtain fresh ideas or new perspectives
        Use this style during stressful times or when trust needs to be built and maintained
        Excessively relying on praise and nurturing can cause mediocre performance overtime
        This will also cause lack of clear strong direction for the company

    Servant
        This makes participative style more one-sided or the leader see his/her job as a means to serve the team
        The Golden Rule is manage other people the way you would like to be managed
        The leader ensures everyone understand their job fully and has all the tools they need before they begin
        If they dont, then the leader will offer plenty of training, learning and improvement opportunities
        This style draws out peak performance because the team are learning vital skills that will improve their performances and also improve them as people
        Their participation, ideas and feedback truly feels like they matter
        Use this style with a diverse team where personalized management is required for each member
        Servant leadership is a great style to start off to gain a great deal of respect, trust and loyalty
        This also strengthen organizational culture since it tailors to the team's needs
        If this style isn't balanced, this could lead to the team members fully running the show creating lack of authority and limited direction and vision

    Freedom
        The leader assigns a task and stay out of the way only to comment and help when needed
        The leader takes on more authoritative role by pointing the team towards a vision or goal
        Similar to other styles, the leader leave the means up to each member
        This style inspires an entrepreneurial spirit with a clear goal among the team members
        Especially when they need a new vision due to changes within the company
        This style can be used when the team has tremendous expertise and have a team of highly experienced employees who dont require alot of supervision
        This style wont work well when the team members are better experts than the leader
        This will lead to poor production, lack of regular feedback, and lack of control

    Transformational
        Transformational leaders affect people's emotions by painting a big exciting picture of the future
        The leader transforms people by tappping into their hopes and dreams and ideals
        The leader motivates employees by being motivated himself/herself
        The leader also enhances productivity through high transparency and communication
        This style uses vision and the future to get the team excited and committed to a project
        It requires the ownership and individual involvement of the team and the leader's to accomplish goals
        Lead by example by being excited and totally committed in everything being said and done
        Use this style to focus on building lasting personal strengths that make the team members more successful 
        The members will be confident in their leader, themselves and the organization
