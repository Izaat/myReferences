1. Introduction
    The structured approact to problem solving
        Provides Transparency
        Opens channels of communication
        Leads to selecting best process
        Improves odd of finding root cause
        Improves customer satisfaction
        
    Example A VS Example B
        Example A:
            The purchasing Department selects Vendor A as supplier
            Turns out Vendor A is completely incompetent
            How will you react?
        
        Example B:
            Vendoe A is selected as supplier.
            The decision is based on several of your employees visiting their plant, customer references being checked and,
            Vendor A's material being used for 1 month prior to signing them on as the  supplier - All positive experiences
            Turns out, vendor A is completely incompetent
        
    Customer Satisfaction Connection
        If you are meeting the commercial expectation of your customers (price, quality and delivery)
            > They will leave you alone        
        If you are not meeting their expectations
            > They will hang out in your backyard, ask alot of questions and challenge everything you do

    Other Problem Solving Methods
        8 Disciplines
        GROW (Goal, Reality, Obstacles/Opinions, Way Forward)
        Kepner - Tregoe
        PDCA
        Rapid Problem Resolution (IT)
        DMAIC
        DMADV
        TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving)
        Lean

    Why Structured approach not used by some
        Don't know any methods
        Isn't any better than adhoc
        "Not invented here" mindset
        Too slow
        "I'm paid to solve problems as I see fit"
        Bad experience with structured approach
        Adhoc gives flexibility
        Experience is the only teacher
        Every problem is unique
        "We are different and therefore not required"

    What is 8D
        8 steps problem solving method
        Used for problems involving defects
        Not suitable for problems of variation, waste elimination or problem prevention
        Based in part on Military Standard 1520 "Corrective Action and Disposition System for Nonconformance"
        Crosses over into many other disciplines of structured thinking
            Kepner Tregoe,
            Scientific Methods,
            PDCA,
            DMAIC,
            Rapid Problem Solution,
            GROW
        Is used on products or process defects occur

    Pros of 8D
        Methodical
        Transparent
        Helps organizations make sense out of nonsense
        Acts as great fire fighting tool
        Brings order to chaos
        Generally faster than other methods
        Documents the problem solving process

2. D0 to D2 (Preliminary Data, Team Selection and Problem Definition)

    D0 - Preliminary Data
        Gather after defect is found
        Capture critical info that may be lost with time.
            Machine
            Operator
            Batch Details
            Time of Failure
            Processing Conditions
            Special circumstances
        Assess Who, What, Where, When Why How
        Decision to use 8D or not 8D

        Refer to D0 of 8D Template
        
    D1 -  Team Selection
        Based on SIPOC Model (Suppliers Inputs Process Output Customers)
        Members should include:-
            Suppliers of the process
            Customers of the process
            Process Representatives
            Subject Matter Expert (Engineers)
            QA
            Others as Necessary

        Smaller teams are desired:
            Easier to manage
            Respond faster
            Better team member participation

        Refer to D1 of 8D Template

    D2 -  Problem Defiition
        (+) - Many Problem sare solved at this stage
            Miscommunication
            Misunderstanding
            Bad Measurement
            Misinformation
            
        (-) - Hardest part of 8D after Root Cause
            Considered trivial or waste of time
            Treated with low importance and priority
            Team is eager to get it solved
            Management expects immediate answers
            Customers want quick resolution

        Problem follows Verb-Noun Format Example:  
            Broken part, Mixed parts, missing thread, wrong label, etc
            
        Must be free of:
            Opinions
            Judgement
            Assumptions
            Solutions
            Blame
            Compound Problems
            Ambiguity

        Caution: Many problem statements are expresed as solutions

        Use IS/IS NOT Format
            Identify what the problem "IS" and "IS NOT"
        Covers Who What Where When Why How
        Ask:
            Can a problem be replicated
            Isolated
            Trending
            Reoccurence
        Include Scope
        Other Relevant information
        
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
3. D3 (Containment)

    A critical step in preventing further defects from reaching customer

            What does it mean to the person
            What does the person need to do differently
            What support can the person expect from us

    Buy-In Containment Action
        What actions are recommended?

        What is the deliverable?
        When will containment be complete?
        Who is:
            Responsible?
            Accountable?
            Consulted?
            Informed?

4. D4 (Root Cause)
    An event, condition or state that when removed, prevents recurrence of an undesirable behavior
    Least understood and most difficult part of 8D
        Need many Root Cause tools at disposal
        Requires practitioner to think
        To get good - need to practice alot

    IS/IS NOT
        Based on problem definition
        Consists of a series of questions
        Looks at problem from multitude views
        Imagine looking at an object from multiple views, perspective will be different
        Ask Who, What Where, When, Why and How
        Ensures team is seeing problem from all possible angles

    5 Whys
        Ask question "Why" 5 or more times and add in "how you confirm" the evidence on every why answers..
        Pitfalls:
            Teams may stop at symptoms believing root cause has been found
            Effectiveness is limited to the collective team knowledge
            Doesnt guide team to ask the right questions
            Different people using 5 Whys may come up with different causes for the same problem
        Note: Mitigate these by grounding the 5 whys in observation and not deduction

    Fishbone
        Problem Definition  
            Materials
            People (Training)
            Measurement
            Machines
            Methods
            Environment
        CNX Variables
            Label all variables as C, N or X where 
            C: Constant
                Those variables which must be held constant and require SOPs to insure consistency
            N: Noise
                Variables which are noise or uncontrolled variables and cannot be easily held constant
            X: POT KPIV
                Variables considered to be potential key process variables to be tested in order to determine their effect on "BIG Y" / Fish Head
    
    Inter-relationship Diagram
        Helps distinguish between Cause and Effectiveness
        Used to understand relationship between issues
        Very good for identifying people or organizational root cause
        Very easy to understand
        Low Time commitment

        Have Issues set in a box and set boxes to form a circle
        For every Box, determine with the other boxes within the circle if there is cause and effect relationship
        Add arrow pointing to the effect if there is Cause and effect
        Do this for every other boxes creating a web
                Point System:
            Out with Strong points = 1 point 
            Out with weak point = 0.5 point
        Add all the points
        The box with the most "Out" points will be the root cause

5. D5 and D6 (Identify Corrective Actions and Implementation)
    
    D5 - Corrective Action
        Based on one or more Root Cause tools identified in previous processes, decide on what are the top 3 most likely root causes
        For each root cause, identify the corrective action (An action to eliminate the cause of a detected nonconformity or other undesired outcome)
        A good practice to describe in detail the corrective action because commonly this is handed off to someone else
        This may be combined with D7 if appropriate

    D6 - Implement and Verify
        List the corrective actions from D5
        Identify the best means of verifying Root Cause
            DOE
            Hypothesis Testing
            Components Swapping
            Correlation and/or Regression Analysis
            On/Off Switching
            Tukey Quick Test
        Verify Root Cause
        
    Tukey's Quick Test
        Select a sample of 8 from the process with the defect
        Implement the first Corrective Action from the above list
        Select a second sample of 8 from the process
        Rank the sample readings from low to high
        Identify each as either "good" or "bad"
        Verify root cause then return to 1 above for next Corrective Action

        Tukey's Table:
        | Sample      |    | Reading      | Good/   |
        | Set         | #  |              | Bad     |

        |     1       | 07 |      -       |    Good |
        |     1       | 08 |      -       |    Good |
        |     2       | 09 |      -       |    Bad  |
        |     2       | 10 |      -       |    Good |
        |     2       | 11 |      -       |    Good |
        |     2       | 12 |      -       |    Good |
        |     2       | 13 |      -       |    Good |
        |     2       | 14 |      -       |    Good |
        |     2       | 15 |      -       |    Good |
        |     2       | 16 |      -       |    Good |

        Identify the total number of CONSECUTIVE Bad Units in a set of samples
        
        Consecutive Bad Units: 3 in sample 1 (From Top Down)
        Consecutive Good Units: 7 in sample 2 (From Bottom UP)
        
        Total 'End Count' : 10 (7+3)
        Based on the Total 'End Count of 10, there is 99% confidence that the likely Root Cause is an actual Root Cause
            otherwise, repeat on the second corrective action
