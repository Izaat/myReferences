1. Introduction
    The structured approact to problem solving
        Provides Transparency
        Opens channels of communication
        Leads to selecting best process
        Improves odd of finding root cause
        Improves customer satisfaction
        
    Example A VS Example B
        Example A:
            The purchasing Department selects Vendor A as supplier
            Turns out Vendor A is completely incompetent
            How will you react?
        
        Example B:
            Vendoe A is selected as supplier.
            The decision is based on several of your employees visiting their plant, customer references being checked and,
            Vendor A's material being used for 1 month prior to signing them on as the  supplier - All positive experiences
            Turns out, vendor A is completely incompetent
        
    Customer Satisfaction Connection
        If you are meeting the commercial expectation of your customers (price, quality and delivery)
            > They will leave you alone        
        If you are not meeting their expectations
            > They will hang out in your backyard, ask alot of questions and challenge everything you do

    Other Problem Solving Methods
        8 Disciplines
        GROW (Goal, Reality, Obstacles/Opinions, Way Forward)
        Kepner - Tregoe
        PDCA
        Rapid Problem Resolution (IT)
        DMAIC
        DMADV
        TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving)
        Lean

    Why Structured approach not used by some
        Don't know any methods
        Isn't any better than adhoc
        "Not invented here" mindset
        Too slow
        "I'm paid to solve problems as I see fit"
        Bad experience with structured approach
        Adhoc gives flexibility
        Experience is the only teacher
        Every problem is unique
        "We are different and therefore not required"

    What is 8D
        8 steps problem solving method
        Used for problems involving defects
        Not suitable for problems of variation, waste elimination or problem prevention
        Based in part on Military Standard 1520 "Corrective Action and Disposition System for Nonconformance"
        Crosses over into many other disciplines of structured thinking
            Kepner Tregoe,
            Scientific Methods,
            PDCA,
            DMAIC,
            Rapid Problem Solution,
            GROW
        Is used on products or process defects occur

    Pros of 8D
        Methodical
        Transparent
        Helps organizations make sense out of nonsense
        Acts as great fire fighting tool
        Brings order to chaos
        Generally faster than other methods
        Documents the problem solving process

2. D0 to D2 (Preliminary Data, Team Selection and Problem Definition)

    D0 - Preliminary Data
        Gather after defect is found
        Capture critical info that may be lost with time.
            Machine
            Operator
            Batch Details
            Time of Failure
            Processing Conditions
            Special circumstances
        Assess Who, What, Where, When Why How
        Decision to use 8D or not 8D

        Refer to D0 of 8D Template
        
    D1 -  Team Selection
        Based on SIPOC Model (Suppliers Inputs Process Output Customers)
        Members should include:-
            Suppliers of the process
            Customers of the process
            Process Representatives
            Subject Matter Expert (Engineers)
            QA
            Others as Necessary

        Smaller teams are desired:
            Easier to manage
            Respond faster
            Better team member participation

        Refer to D1 of 8D Template

    D2 -  Problem Defiition
        (+) - Many Problem sare solved at this stage
            Miscommunication
            Misunderstanding
            Bad Measurement
            Misinformation
            
        (-) - Hardest part of 8D after Root Cause
            Considered trivial or waste of time
            Treated with low importance and priority
            Team is eager to get it solved
            Management expects immediate answers
            Customers want quick resolution

        Problem follows Verb-Noun Format Example:  
            Broken part, Mixed parts, missing thread, wrong label, etc
            
        Must be free of:
            Opinions
            Judgement
            Assumptions
            Solutions
            Blame
            Compound Problems
            Ambiguity

        Caution: Many problem statements are expresed as solutions

        Use IS/IS NOT Format
            Identify what the problem "IS" and "IS NOT"
        Covers Who What Where When Why How
        Ask:
            Can a problem be replicated
            Isolated
            Trending
            Reoccurence
        Include Scope
        Other Relevant information
