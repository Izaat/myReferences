    What is ISO14001
        An international standard that prescribes the requirements for establishing the Environmental Management System (EMS)
        Main part of the standard consists of 11 clauses
        Clause 0-3 are not really important (Description of standards)
        Clause 4-10 prescribes the requirements

    Structure
        Clause 0 - Gives the general overview of the standard and its compatibility with other standard
        Clause 1 - Scope - Defines the scope of the standard (States that ISO14001 is applicable to all types of organizations)
        Clause 2 - Normative Ref - Terms and definitions are given  in 14000
        Clause 3 - Terms and Condition - Terms and definitions are given  in 14000
        Clause 4 - Context of Organization - Gives the requirement for understanding the internal/external issues, interested parties and scope of EMS
        Clause 5 - Leadership - Defines responsibilities of top management to set the roles and responsibilities within EMS and establish environmental policy
        Clause 6 - Planning - Defines requirements for addressing risks/opportunities identification and evaluation of environmental aspects,
                              Compliance obligations, establishing environmental objectives and plans for achieving them
        Clause 7 - Support - Defines requirements for availibility of resources, competences, awareness, communication, and documented information
        Clause 8 - Operation - Defines requirements for operational planning&control AND emergency preparedness&response 
        Clause 9 - Performance evaluation - Defines requirements for measurements, monitoring, evaluation, analysis, internal audit and management review
        Clause 10 - Improvement - Requirements for nonconformities, corrective actions and continual improvements
        Annex A - Guidance on using ISO14001 - Only informative and doesnt add or change the standard
        Annex B - Correspondence between ISO14001:2015 and ISO14001:2004 - An overview of the relationship, also only informative

    Environmental Management System (EMS)
        A systematic approach to protecting the environment
        Enables organization to achieve intended results set in the EMS
        EMS represents a set of policies, procedures, operational control, and rules for environmental protection of company
        Environmental rules and controls that are to be implemented, will be decided based on the identification and evaluation of the environmental aspects
        Each environmental aspects consists of different combination of operational controls to be implemented (i.e toxic waste management)
        Important o show the employees what the best practices are and what they should observe
        
        Examples:
            Documenting a procedure is an operational control
            Introducing new technology to reduce toxic waste is an engineering control
            Training of employees is HR control

    Implementing ISO14001 requirements
        In order to be compliant, all requirements of the standard must be fulfilled
        ISO14001 is implemented and maintained through PDCA cycle, 
        
        Plan phase: 
            Understanding the context of the organization (i.e Dont do nuclear waste for paper factories)
            Define EMS scope
            Establish Environmental Policy
            Conducting identification and evaluation of environmental aspects 
            Identification of compliance obligations
            Planning operational controls
        Do phase: 
            Implementation of operational controls to fulfill the requirements set by EMS
            Achieving environmental objectives
            Regular reassessment of environmental aspects
        Check phase:
            Regular monitoring - whether the result achieves the requirement set in Plan phase 
            Internal audits
            Management reviews
        Act phase: 
            Fine tuning the process (Closing the gap between Crrent results and Planned results) - Aka improvements
            Implementing corrective actions and improvement initiatives
        
    Implementing ISO14001 as a Project
        Form a team and assign them with concrete roles
        Project Manager - Coordinates the project for implementation
        Project team - People under the coordination of the project manager (documenting and implementing)
        Management representative - Responsible for maintaining the EMS and its continual improvement (Usually also the project manager)
        Top management - Supports the process by showing commitment, setting objectives, making decisions, providing resources (manpower, budget, etc)
        
    Documenting ISO14001 requirements
        Deciding which policies or procedures to document and to what level of details
        Each clause specifies if the requirement needs to be documented or not
        First check if the document is mandatory (ie. the organization shall retain documented information of ...)
        Criterias that are mandatory
            EMS, 
            Environmental policy, 
            Identification and evaluation of environmental aspects and methodology, 
            Compliance obligations, 
            Environmental objectives and plans to achieve them
            Records of training, skills, experience and qualifications
            Evidence of communications
            Operational control
            Emergency preparedness and response
            Monitoring and measurement
            Internal audit program and results
            Management review results
            Results of corrective actions
        Criterias to decide whether it is not mandatory
            Risks - check the aspect evaluation results to see if there is a need for such a control
            Size of the company - Smaller companies tend to have lesser documents (Avoid writing procedure for every small processes)
            Importance and complexity - The more complex or important the process is, the more likely to be documented
        ISO14001 does not specify what kind of documentation is required for operating the EMS - Free to tailor the documents according to its needs

    Benefits
        Improves company image and credibility - Helps improve community relationship hence improving the market share
        Helps organizations to comply with legal requirements - Provides framework for identifying, monitoring and complying with requirements
        Improves cost control - 
            Helps identify, control and reduce the number of environmental incidents
            Existence of improvement aspects of EMS to reduce costs by working to conserve energy and input materials required
            Higher rate of success when implementing changes - Usage of good and accurate data (Key aspects of the standard)
            Enable quicker improvement of processes - Continual improvement culture
            Reduce employee turnover - Employees engaged in other aspects of the company

    Understanding your organization and its context [Clause 4.1]
        Analyze the external and internal issues related to the ability of the company to achieve the intended outcomes of EMS
        This will give a better understanding of the company and the context in which it operates
        Issues arising from the external environment must be taken into consideration when defining EMS
        External Contexts: 
            Legal and regulatory requirements, 
            Economic environment 
            Political environment
            Social and cultural norms
            Competitive environment
        For the EMS to be effective, it also must be aligned with all the internal contexts
        Internal Contexts:
            Organizational structure
            Company culture
            Company values
            Business Strategy
            Business processes
            Technologies being used
            Available resources
            Organizational knowledge
        NOTE: The EMS of a large pharma corporation will be much more complex than the family owned fashion company
        Important: The standard requires the internal and external issues to be analyzed but does not require them to be documented
            
    Understanding the needs and expectations of interested parties [Clause 4.2]
        Requires to identify the interested parties which are significant for echievement of the environmental objectives
        There can be different interested parties depending on the nature of the business
        Interested parties:
            Local authorities
            Local communities
            Suppliers
            Partners
            Clients
            Employees
        Determine the requirements regarding the EMS of the interested parties since different parties have different requirements
        See the bigger picture and understand the needs of the company
        The Clause requires interested parties to be analyzed but not required to be documented

    Determine the scope of the EMS [Clause 4.3]
        Define and document the scope of the EMS
        The scope sets the boundaries of the EMS as it will be written in ISO14001 certificate
        Consider the followings prior to defining the scope
            What the company wants to achieve 
            The results of previous analyses of issues and interested parties
            The activities of the organization and other organizations (Associates, partners, vendors)
            How those activities are related and how they depend on each other
        The standard requires the scope to be documented
        The scope document includes the followings:
            Product and services the company provides,
            Location,
            All Processes, 
            All departments
        Example:
            The Environmental Management System (EMS) applies to the production and / or service provision processes.
            The EMS applies to the provision of products and services, outsourcing of vehicle maintenance, operating from the offices in UK.

    Leadership and Commitment [Clause 5.1]
        Covers 3 aspects: 
            Leadership and Commitment, 
            Environmental policy, 
            Organizational roles and responsibilities
        Commitments:
            Establishing environmental policy and objectives
            Ensuring availability of resources (allocating people, time and fincaial resources)
            Communicating the importance of environment protection
            Demonstrating leadership by setting good examples
            Ensuring EMS is integrated within company processes
            Promoting continuous improvement of the EMS (Suggestion box, emails, projects)
        ISO14001 requires top management to demonstrate leadership and commitment but doesnt require to be documented

    Environmental Policy [Clause 5.2]
        The policy is mandatory to be documented, distributed to all employees and available to interested parties
        Policy should reflect the intentions of the company regarding the environment
        The policy should demonstrate the top management's commitment to satisfy environment safety rules and continually improve the EMS
        Top management should also give the directions for setting the environmental objectives
        The policy is a top level policy and shouldn't be too detailed
        The details should be documented in another document i.e procedures

    Organizational roles, responsibilities and authorities [Clause 5.3]
        Top management are responsible for the followings:
            Define the responsibilities and authorities for the roles and communicate them to everyone
            Assigning and communicating roles and responsibilities so everyone in the organization knows what is expected and the impacts
        Top management must assign responsibilities for 2 main aspects
            Ensuring the EMS is compliant to ISO14001
            Monitoring and Reporting the effectiveness of EMS
        Roles can be allocated to one or more roles or people depending on the company size
        The standard does not require roles and responsibilities to be documented 
        But it is more practical to communicate them once they're documented
        The roles can be documented in job description, organizational chart, policies, plans or other documents created during ISO14001 implementation
        
    Environmental Objectives [Clause 6.2]
        Covers the requirements to address risks and opportunities
        Sets the basis for continual improvement of the EMS
        Demonstrates the priorities in environmental protection
        Things to be considered:
            Aligned with the environmental policy
            Should be easily measured in order to monitor the progress of the achievement
            The needs of the company and results of the identification and evaluation of environmental aspects
            Objectives should be updated in order to reflect the current state in the company and its EMS
            Communicated to all interested parties
        To ensure fulfillment of the objectives, create plan to achieve them by:
            Assigning the responsible person, 
            Allocating resources, 
            Define deadline for completion, etc
        The standard requires the environmental objectives to be documented (Usually 1 single document) - Description, Measurable target, timeframe
            Example: "To decreae electrical energy consumption by 20% in the following year"
            
    Resources [Clause 7.1]
        Defines the requirements for availibility of resources, competences, awareness, communication and control of documented information
        The standard requires companies to ensure the resources are available for the EMS, the daily activities and continual improvement of the EMS
        This also includes allocating people and time for the activities
        Without the appropriate resources, EMS cannot run smoothly
        Provision of resources is prescribed as a management commitment
        Example:
            Increasing the environmental awareness trainings for 2 hours per employee
            Then the management will assign this responsibility (usually to the EHS Manager)
            The employees then will be given 2 more hours for this training
            Manager will also find out if there is enough time to conduct the training and the financial resources to hire consultants or trainers
        The standard does not require this clause to be documented but it is very common to document through the budget, HR plan, environmental objectives and plans for achievement

    Competence [Clause 7.2]
        Requires to define competencies for all employees and to make sure they have appropriate training and experience
        Determining the competencies is based on education, training, and experience
        Companies should take certain actions for people to acquire the necessary competency 
            Example: Sending to training and in-house trainings, providing mentorship, reassigning to another position
        Companies should alse keep records of employees competence (Certificates, recommendations, attendance of trainings, etc)
        A good practice on managing employees is to establish a procedure for managing human resources
        Procedures to include when employing new people:
            Performance appraisals
            Defining training needs
            Documenting training plan
            etc
        
    Awareness [Clause 7.3]
        Requires all employees to be aware of the environmental policy, their roles and the impact on EMS
        All employees should also know the consequences if the EMS rules arent followed
        Methods for raising awareness
            Emails and news letters
            Organizing trainings
            Attending online courses
            Environment safety meetings
            Events and gatherings
            etc
        The standard does not require awareness activities to be documented unless the company require a more structured approach
            Example: Awareness raising plans (Trainings, newsletters, etc), defined period and resources needed
        
    Communication [Clause 7.4]
        Requires companies to define the needs for internal/external communications and to define what and when will be communicated and by whom
        Communication is the essence of understanding
        This clause does not require the communication rules to be documented
        The communication rule can be more or less formal, fully documented or stated in a few sentences within other policies, procedures and plans
        
    Documented information [Clause 7.5]
        Defines the requirements about how the documented information should be created, controlled and updated 
        Generally there are 2 types of documents:
            How processes should be conducted (ie policies, procedures, plans, etc)
            Evidence and Activities performed (records, logs, databases, etc)
        Updating (Consider the followings)
            Appropriate identification and description (title, date, name, etc)
            Proper media format
        Document should be approved and reviewed to make sure they're appropriate
        Company should control the documented information to ensure it availability
        Ensure that the documents are protected from the loss of confidentiality, integrity and improper use
        Document control measures include:
            How to distribute, access, retrieve and use the information (Emails, usb, password protected, limited access, etc)
            How to store and preserve the information (storing in shared folders, preservation in archives, stored in locked cabinets, etc)
            How to control the changes (varsion control)
            How to dispose the documented information - company should determine how long the socument should be preserved
                Identify documents regulated by the law and control them according to the law
                Decide how to control the rest of the documented information
            The company must control the information from external sources (emails from customers, instruction manuals for equipment, laws, etc)
        ISO14001 does not require the rules to be documented but it is a good practice to document the in a procedure
