    What is ISO14001
        An international standard that prescribes the requirements for establishing the Environmental Management System (EMS)
        Main part of the standard consists of 11 clauses
        Clause 0-3 are not really important (Description of standards)
        Clause 4-10 prescribes the requirements

    Structure
        Clause 0 - Gives the general overview of the standard and its compatibility with other standard
        Clause 1 - Scope - Defines the scope of the standard (States that ISO14001 is applicable to all types of organizations)
        Clause 2 - Normative Ref - Terms and definitions are given  in 14000
        Clause 3 - Terms and Condition - Terms and definitions are given  in 14000
        Clause 4 - Context of Organization - Gives the requirement for understanding the internal/external issues, interested parties and scope of EMS
        Clause 5 - Leadership - Defines responsibilities of top management to set the roles and responsibilities within EMS and establish environmental policy
        Clause 6 - Planning - Defines requirements for addressing risks/opportunities identification and evaluation of environmental aspects,
                              Compliance obligations, establishing environmental objectives and plans for achieving them
        Clause 7 - Support - Defines requirements for availibility of resources, competences, awareness, communication, and documented information
        Clause 8 - Operation - Defines requirements for operational planning&control AND emergency preparedness&response 
        Clause 9 - Performance evaluation - Defines requirements for measurements, monitoring, evaluation, analysis, internal audit and management review
        Clause 10 - Improvement - Requirements for nonconformities, corrective actions and continual improvements
        Annex A - Guidance on using ISO14001 - Only informative and doesnt add or change the standard
        Annex B - Correspondence between ISO14001:2015 and ISO14001:2004 - An overview of the relationship, also only informative

    Environmental Management System (EMS)
        A systematic approach to protecting the environment
        Enables organization to achieve intended results set in the EMS
        EMS represents a set of policies, procedures, operational control, and rules for environmental protection of company
        Environmental rules and controls that are to be implemented, will be decided based on the identification and evaluation of the environmental aspects
        Each environmental aspects consists of different combination of operational controls to be implemented (i.e toxic waste management)
        Important o show the employees what the best practices are and what they should observe
        
        Examples:
            Documenting a procedure is an operational control
            Introducing new technology to reduce toxic waste is an engineering control
            Training of employees is HR control

    Implementing ISO14001 requirements
        In order to be compliant, all requirements of the standard must be fulfilled
        ISO14001 is implemented and maintained through PDCA cycle, 
        
        Plan phase: 
            Understanding the context of the organization (i.e Dont do nuclear waste for paper factories)
            Define EMS scope
            Establish Environmental Policy
            Conducting identification and evaluation of environmental aspects 
            Identification of compliance obligations
            Planning operational controls
        Do phase: 
            Implementation of operational controls to fulfill the requirements set by EMS
            Achieving environmental objectives
            Regular reassessment of environmental aspects
        Check phase:
            Regular monitoring - whether the result achieves the requirement set in Plan phase 
            Internal audits
            Management reviews
        Act phase: 
            Fine tuning the process (Closing the gap between Crrent results and Planned results) - Aka improvements
            Implementing corrective actions and improvement initiatives
        
    Implementing ISO14001 as a Project
        Form a team and assign them with concrete roles
        Project Manager - Coordinates the project for implementation
        Project team - People under the coordination of the project manager (documenting and implementing)
        Management representative - Responsible for maintaining the EMS and its continual improvement (Usually also the project manager)
        Top management - Supports the process by showing commitment, setting objectives, making decisions, providing resources (manpower, budget, etc)
        
    Documenting ISO14001 requirements
        Deciding which policies or procedures to document and to what level of details
        Each clause specifies if the requirement needs to be documented or not
        First check if the document is mandatory (ie. the organization shall retain documented information of ...)
        Criterias that are mandatory
            EMS, 
            Environmental policy, 
            Identification and evaluation of environmental aspects and methodology, 
            Compliance obligations, 
            Environmental objectives and plans to achieve them
            Records of training, skills, experience and qualifications
            Evidence of communications
            Operational control
            Emergency preparedness and response
            Monitoring and measurement
            Internal audit program and results
            Management review results
            Results of corrective actions
        Criterias to decide whether it is not mandatory
            Risks - check the aspect evaluation results to see if there is a need for such a control
            Size of the company - Smaller companies tend to have lesser documents (Avoid writing procedure for every small processes)
            Importance and complexity - The more complex or important the process is, the more likely to be documented
        ISO14001 does not specify what kind of documentation is required for operating the EMS - Free to tailor the documents according to its needs

    Benefits
        Improves company image and credibility - Helps improve community relationship hence improving the market share
        Helps organizations to comply with legal requirements - Provides framework for identifying, monitoring and complying with requirements
        Improves cost control - 
            Helps identify, control and reduce the number of environmental incidents
            Existence of improvement aspects of EMS to reduce costs by working to conserve energy and input materials required
            Higher rate of success when implementing changes - Usage of good and accurate data (Key aspects of the standard)
            Enable quicker improvement of processes - Continual improvement culture
            Reduce employee turnover - Employees engaged in other aspects of the company

    Understanding your organization and its context [Clause 4.1]
        Analyze the external and internal issues related to the ability of the company to achieve the intended outcomes of EMS
        This will give a better understanding of the company and the context in which it operates
        Issues arising from the external environment must be taken into consideration when defining EMS
        External Contexts: 
            Legal and regulatory requirements, 
            Economic environment 
            Political environment
            Social and cultural norms
            Competitive environment
        For the EMS to be effective, it also must be aligned with all the internal contexts
        Internal Contexts:
            Organizational structure
            Company culture
            Company values
            Business Strategy
            Business processes
            Technologies being used
            Available resources
            Organizational knowledge
        NOTE: The EMS of a large pharma corporation will be much more complex than the family owned fashion company
        Important: The standard requires the internal and external issues to be analyzed but does not require them to be documented
            
    Understanding the needs and expectations of interested parties [Clause 4.2]
        Requires to identify the interested parties which are significant for echievement of the environmental objectives
        There can be different interested parties depending on the nature of the business
        Interested parties:
            Local authorities
            Local communities
            Suppliers
            Partners
            Clients
            Employees
        Determine the requirements regarding the EMS of the interested parties since different parties have different requirements
        See the bigger picture and understand the needs of the company
        The Clause requires interested parties to be analyzed but not required to be documented

    Determine the scope of the EMS [Clause 4.3]
        Define and document the scope of the EMS
        The scope sets the boundaries of the EMS as it will be written in ISO14001 certificate
        Consider the followings prior to defining the scope
            What the company wants to achieve 
            The results of previous analyses of issues and interested parties
            The activities of the organization and other organizations (Associates, partners, vendors)
            How those activities are related and how they depend on each other
        The standard requires the scope to be documented
        The scope document includes the followings:
            Product and services the company provides,
            Location,
            All Processes, 
            All departments
        Example:
            The Environmental Management System (EMS) applies to the production and / or service provision processes.
            The EMS applies to the provision of products and services, outsourcing of vehicle maintenance, operating from the offices in UK.

    Leadership and Commitment [Clause 5.1]
        Covers 3 aspects: 
            Leadership and Commitment, 
            Environmental policy, 
            Organizational roles and responsibilities
        Commitments:
            Establishing environmental policy and objectives
            Ensuring availability of resources (allocating people, time and fincaial resources)
            Communicating the importance of environment protection
            Demonstrating leadership by setting good examples
            Ensuring EMS is integrated within company processes
            Promoting continuous improvement of the EMS (Suggestion box, emails, projects)
        ISO14001 requires top management to demonstrate leadership and commitment but doesnt require to be documented

    Environmental Policy [Clause 5.2]
        The policy is mandatory to be documented, distributed to all employees and available to interested parties
        Policy should reflect the intentions of the company regarding the environment
        The policy should demonstrate the top management's commitment to satisfy environment safety rules and continually improve the EMS
        Top management should also give the directions for setting the environmental objectives
        The policy is a top level policy and shouldn't be too detailed
        The details should be documented in another document i.e procedures

    Organizational roles, responsibilities and authorities [Clause 5.3]
        Top management are responsible for the followings:
            Define the responsibilities and authorities for the roles and communicate them to everyone
            Assigning and communicating roles and responsibilities so everyone in the organization knows what is expected and the impacts
        Top management must assign responsibilities for 2 main aspects
            Ensuring the EMS is compliant to ISO14001
            Monitoring and Reporting the effectiveness of EMS
        Roles can be allocated to one or more roles or people depending on the company size
        The standard does not require roles and responsibilities to be documented 
        But it is more practical to communicate them once they're documented
        The roles can be documented in job description, organizational chart, policies, plans or other documents created during ISO14001 implementation
        
    Environmental Objectives [Clause 6.2]
        Covers the requirements to address risks and opportunities
        Sets the basis for continual improvement of the EMS
        Demonstrates the priorities in environmental protection
        Things to be considered:
            Aligned with the environmental policy
            Should be easily measured in order to monitor the progress of the achievement
            The needs of the company and results of the identification and evaluation of environmental aspects
            Objectives should be updated in order to reflect the current state in the company and its EMS
            Communicated to all interested parties
        To ensure fulfillment of the objectives, create plan to achieve them by:
            Assigning the responsible person, 
            Allocating resources, 
            Define deadline for completion, etc
        The standard requires the environmental objectives to be documented (Usually 1 single document) - Description, Measurable target, timeframe
            Example: "To decreae electrical energy consumption by 20% in the following year"
            
    Resources [Clause 7.1]
        Defines the requirements for availibility of resources, competences, awareness, communication and control of documented information
        The standard requires companies to ensure the resources are available for the EMS, the daily activities and continual improvement of the EMS
        This also includes allocating people and time for the activities
        Without the appropriate resources, EMS cannot run smoothly
        Provision of resources is prescribed as a management commitment
        Example:
            Increasing the environmental awareness trainings for 2 hours per employee
            Then the management will assign this responsibility (usually to the EHS Manager)
            The employees then will be given 2 more hours for this training
            Manager will also find out if there is enough time to conduct the training and the financial resources to hire consultants or trainers
        The standard does not require this clause to be documented but it is very common to document through the budget, HR plan, environmental objectives and plans for achievement

    Competence [Clause 7.2]
        Requires to define competencies for all employees and to make sure they have appropriate training and experience
        Determining the competencies is based on education, training, and experience
        Companies should take certain actions for people to acquire the necessary competency 
            Example: Sending to training and in-house trainings, providing mentorship, reassigning to another position
        Companies should alse keep records of employees competence (Certificates, recommendations, attendance of trainings, etc)
        A good practice on managing employees is to establish a procedure for managing human resources
        Procedures to include when employing new people:
            Performance appraisals
            Defining training needs
            Documenting training plan
            etc
        
    Awareness [Clause 7.3]
        Requires all employees to be aware of the environmental policy, their roles and the impact on EMS
        All employees should also know the consequences if the EMS rules arent followed
        Methods for raising awareness
            Emails and news letters
            Organizing trainings
            Attending online courses
            Environment safety meetings
            Events and gatherings
            etc
        The standard does not require awareness activities to be documented unless the company require a more structured approach
            Example: Awareness raising plans (Trainings, newsletters, etc), defined period and resources needed
        
    Communication [Clause 7.4]
        Requires companies to define the needs for internal/external communications and to define what and when will be communicated and by whom
        Communication is the essence of understanding
        This clause does not require the communication rules to be documented
        The communication rule can be more or less formal, fully documented or stated in a few sentences within other policies, procedures and plans
        
    Documented information [Clause 7.5]
        Defines the requirements about how the documented information should be created, controlled and updated 
        Generally there are 2 types of documents:
            How processes should be conducted (ie policies, procedures, plans, etc)
            Evidence and Activities performed (records, logs, databases, etc)
        Updating (Consider the followings)
            Appropriate identification and description (title, date, name, etc)
            Proper media format
        Document should be approved and reviewed to make sure they're appropriate
        Company should control the documented information to ensure it availability
        Ensure that the documents are protected from the loss of confidentiality, integrity and improper use
        Document control measures include:
            How to distribute, access, retrieve and use the information (Emails, usb, password protected, limited access, etc)
            How to store and preserve the information (storing in shared folders, preservation in archives, stored in locked cabinets, etc)
            How to control the changes (varsion control)
            How to dispose the documented information - company should determine how long the socument should be preserved
                Identify documents regulated by the law and control them according to the law
                Decide how to control the rest of the documented information
            The company must control the information from external sources (emails from customers, instruction manuals for equipment, laws, etc)
        ISO14001 does not require the rules to be documented but it is a good practice to document the in a procedure

    Addressing Risks and Opportunities [Clause 6.1.1]
        Identify all factors (risk and opportunities) that can affect the company from achieving EMS objectives during the planning stage of the EMS
        Considerations should be done on much higher level than "identification and evaluation" stage of environmental aspects
        Opportunity example:
            Heat produced by one process can be used to heat up an area in another part of the facility (Affects energy usage)
            Opportunities like this cannot be identified during identification and evaluation stage
        The "identification and evaluation" stage leaves out the external context as it only focuses on processes inside the company
        Risk example:
            Pollutants in the neighborhood enhances the environment impact on the environment
        The documents needed for addressing risks and opportunities:
            A list of risks and opportunities that needs to be addressed
            Rules, instructions or SOPs to ensure that everything is carried out as planned
        The standard doesnt require risk management to be documented

    Environmental aspects and Impacts [Clause 6.1.2]
        The company needs to identify environment aspects and associate them with environmental impacts
        Also determnie the significant aspects adressed by EMS 
        The environmental objectives, operational controls and other elements are directly linked to the significant environment aspects
        The aspects are elements of the company activities, products or services that interacts with the environment
            Example: Raw materials and process by products
        Changes in the environment (beneficial or adverse) resulting from the environment aspects are called environmental impact
        Relationship between aspects and impacts is the one of cause and effect

    Identification of Environmental Aspects [Clause 6.1.2]
        Provides foundation of future activities
        Initialize by breaking down operating processes into activities and consider their inputs and outputs
        Things to Consider during identification:
            Relevant past products, services and activities (including planned and new developments) 
                Speak to the process owner to get the better insights and to avoid missing something out
                In larger companies, the process owners will identify the environmental aspects of their own processes
            Lifecycle of the product and services
                Identify the aspects that can emerge along the way
                Stages in its lifecycle that can be controlled or influenced
                Typical stages: 
                    Raw material acquisition
                    Production
                    Development
                    Transportation
                    Delivery
                    Usage
                    End of life treatment
                    Final disposition
            Normal and abnormal operating conditions
                Shut-down and startup
                Potential emergency situations (Spills, leaks, etc)
        The company does not have to consider each product, component or raw materials individually when identifying aspects
        The company may instead group activities, products and services with common characteristics
            Example: Same processses and raw materials for several products will be merged into one group
            Helpful to have a list of all aspects related to the company (Processes, products, services, related impacts)
        The standard requires all aspects and impacts to be documented but does not have to be separated from the evaluation of aspects
            This way, same document can be used to meet the two requirements

    Evaluation of Environmental Aspects [Clause 6.1.2]
        The standard requires to establish methods and criteria for evaluation
        The method and criteria need to be documented through procedure (Document details depend on the size of the company)
        After the aspects are determined, it'll be easier to know where to focus on the EMS and it will also prevent unwanted usage of the resources
        The method and criteria should provide the consistent results 
        The company sets the criteria for determining significant environment aspects
        For small companies, only 2 criteria is required, "probability of occurence and severity of consequence" (Similar to FMEA - S*O*D)
        For larger companies, scale, duration, exposure to environment, recovery time can be added
        In order to determine the level of severity/significance, create a scale and define by multiplication (Similar to risk assessment methods)
        If some environmental aspects are regulated by law, it becomes automatically significant
        The most effective method is not the one with highest severity/significance value but the one with accurate results

    Compliance Obligations [Clause 6.1.3]
        Penalties of noncompliance can be severe (Penalties, loss of contracts, bad reputation)
        Company needs to determine compliance obligations, document them, and evaluate the compliance
        Compliance Obligations include:
            Legal requirements (International, national and local laws)
            Obligations the company agree voluntarily (Conformance to a standard or rules of some association)
            Requirements specified permits, licenses oandother form of authorizations
            Rules, orders and guidance by regulatory agencies
            Decisions by court or administrative tribunals
            Requirements of other interested parties
                Agreement with NGOs and community groups
                Agreements with public authorities or customers
                Organizational requirements (ie ISO)
                Voluntary principles and code of practice
                Obligations from contracts

        All obligations need to be documented in a form of records
        Level of details is not prescribed by the standard but advisable to include title and description.
        Assign responsibility for complying with the obligations
        Deadline to meet the requirements can also be defined
        Allocate resources needed

    Planning the implementation [Claluse 6.1.4]
        Company must plan actions to address risks and opportunities (Only those that leads to unacceptable outcome), aspects (high severity) and compliances (ALL)
        Address risks to decrease impact, seize opportunities and reach full compliance
        The purpose is to ensure EMS provides intended results
        Actions can be in various forms: Part of objectives, plans or new operational controls
        The actions can also address some other management systems (ie OHS or Business continuity management system)
        Example: 
            Company decides to reduce CO2 emission
            Formulate this through environmental objectives
            Plan the objectives by defining financial resources to purchase the filter and installation to be done by end of year
            Assign production manager to be responsible
            Define monitoring and maintenance 
            Conduct filter monitoring schedule and change them regularly
            Employees responsible will need to attend some training so it will be entered into the training plan
            In order for plans to come to realization, incorporate the actions into everyday activities and EMS processes
            Update procedures, rules, create a new EMS procedure, arrange awareness trainings and create new processes
            Evaluate the effectiveness of actions to determine they delivered what being expected in the plan (Done in performance evaluation)

    Operational Planning and Control [Clause 8.1]
        Define activities to decrease the impact 
        Achieve by implementing operational controls
        Purpose of operational controls is to decrease pollution, maintain compliance, improve EMS, achieve environmental objectives
        For every process with high severity aspect, operational control must be established
        To establish operational control:
            Establish operating criteria for the process - determine target values/parameters
            Define activities to decrease negative impact of the aspect
            Criteria should be based on its effect on environment
            Fulfill other legal requirements
        Define Operating Criteria
            The process should be considered "out of lifecycle" to determine its additional requirements and providing additional information regarding stages in the lifecycle
            Example: 
                During process of designing of a new product, company may include requirements for env protection during production
                Or include information about recycling the product in instruction manual
                After determining the activities for the process, impact with significant aspects can be influenced
        Define new activities or change existing ones to decrease environmental impact 
            Example: Waste disposal activities -> Recycling
            Monitoring and measuring can be introduced (i.e measurement of gas emissions)
        Defining the way of documenting the operational control
            The standard does not require which kind of protection method must be used as it all depends on type of business, environment, etc
            But it requires operational controls to be documented to the extent necessary to have confidence that the process have been carried out as planned
            The company has freedom to decide whether to document the operational control  in a procedure, guidelines, or other document
            Process criteria:
                Complex operational controls
                Complex processes
                High risk of making mistakes
                Activities not often carried out
            For Simple Processes, short and simple guidelines is sufficient
            Document must contain enough information to define roles, responsibilities and properly conduct activities
            Also important to define methods and frequency for reviewing activities to ensure activities are performed as plannes
            Review the effectiveness of operational controls (Done during environmental performance review and internal audits)

    Managing outsourcing of operations [Clause 8.1]
        ISO14001 requires all outsourced processes to be identified and controlled regarding environmental protection
        The company should first make sure that the hired company follows their environmental protection rules (Proper waste disposal, etc)
        The outsourcer must document a procedure and include all the environmental protection rules
        Then communicate the procedure to its partner and get acceptance
        The outsourcee company will get the requirements in writing so they could facilitate the fulfilllment of client's requirements
        The outsourcer is then be able to control outsourced process
        When a process/product/service is supplied by external provider, the ability of the control can vary from direct control, limited control or no control
        No control when the outsourcee is a major corporation overseas
        In some cases, some products/services can be excluded from operational controls
        The control should be documented as any other operational control "to the extent necessary to achieve confidence that process is being carried out as planned"

    Controlling Changes [Clause 8.1]
        The standard requires the company to manafe the changes by planning and controlling the implementation
        Also, it requires the company to analyze the changes and deal with unexpected changes to decrease unwanted effects
        NOTE: The biggest loophole in EMS is when changes are being made especially when these changes are unplanned and unexpected
        Example:
            When top management decides to change the technology (ie filter removal from chimneys),
            This implication should be analyzed to anticipate consequences and make plans how to deal with them
            The person incharge of the change should analyze, make a report and explain to the top management
            Explanations should include what should be done, the resources needed, time schedule for planned activities and a project team for implementing the change
            Based on the report, the top management should make decision and to what extent to approve the change
        Issues that can be critical for environmental protection are: 
            Changes in the processes, 
            Development of new products, 
            Introduction of new technologies, 
            Changing the energy source, etc
        The standard has no requirements for documenting the changes
        The best practice to plan and effectively implement changes is to develop the procedure for change management
        Change Management Procedure should include:
            Information about who and how to initiate changes
            What kind of analysis should be conducted and documented
            Who will approve and implement the changes

    Emergency Preparedness and Response [Clause 8.2]
        Emergency situations are some unplanned or unexpected events that results in adverse consequences to the company or environment
        So the event require immediate actions to mitigate, prevent actual/potential consequences 
        Being prepared helps to prevent injuries, contamination of the workplace and the environment
        Example:
            If chemical spill happened, the response will be more effective  if there is already a plan that was tested beforehand
            The employees will know who and how to perform the containment, who will talk to the public, etc
        Handling emergencies is important for the reputation and even the survival of the company
        
        Identify potential emergency situations - 
            Process of addressing risks and opportunities can be a great help
            External issues, can be a guidance in identifying potential emergency situations
                i.e company located in the area that is vulnerable to flood, droughts, earthquakes
            Internal issues, should be taken into account when determining emergency situations
                i.e usage of highly flammable substances or outdated equipment
        Plan the emergency preparedness and response process
            There may be some similar activities for every emergency, some activities are specific for each situation
            Consider defining methodology for response - What actions will be taken and in which order
            Example: The employee will first take actions for containment while others require evacuation
        Communication process during emergency
            Inside the company (Alarm, PA system, etc)
            Outside the company (Who will talk to the public, who will activate the fire department, spillage cleaning services, etc)
            What actions will be taken to mitigate consequences (How employee extinguish fire or how to turn off machine during flooding)
        Assessing needs for post emergency evaluation to determine and implement corrective actions
            Actions taken during emergency need to be reviewed after the emergency whether the plan was implemented correctly
            Check for mistakes and how they can be prevented
        Trainings
            Due to the unexpected nature of emergencies, all employees must know their roles and responsibilities and to execute without delay
            Who switch off machines, who provides first aid, who will talk to fire department, etc
            To achieve them, the company must conduct trainings and periodical testing of the response actions
            Also to evaluate them in order to improve the response and to determine needs for relevant training
            
        Emergency preparedness and response process need to be documented as procedures to ensure emergencies will be handled as planned
        The standard requires evidence of testing and evaluation of emergency response
        Corrective action records from emergency response evaluation can be used as evidence that testing and evaluation was conducted
        The standard doesnt explicitly require scenarios and equipment used to be documented

    Operating the EMS [Clause 8.1]
        The EMS must be operated on daily basis
        The daily operation represents a real compliance to the ISO14001 and is the only way to benefit from the implementation
        Make sure to revisit all activities that were planned in the policies and procedures
        If some of the document doesn't make sense or is too complicated, then simplify or delete if they are not mandatory
        Note that the circumstances of the company will change by creating new products, adding services, introduced new technology
        With these changes, policies and procedures need to be updated
        The best practice for keeping updates is to nominate an owner of the document and the owner is to review them periodically

    Monitoring, Measurement, Analysis and Evaluation [Clause 9.1]
        Define the requirements for evaluating the environmental performance and the effectiveness of EMS
        This is done by monitoring, measuring, analyses and evaluation 
        Monitoring refers to reviewing and observing 
        Measuring refers to determining the amount/size of something by using concrete values
        Analyses refers to examining the results of measurements
        Evaluation refers to making conclusions based on analyses

        Monitoring and Measuring are closely related to significant environmental aspects
            Example: Monitoring amount of toxic gas into the atmosphere for nuclear power plant
        Monitoring and measuring parameters represent criteria to determine effectiveness of the EMS
            Example: Reduction of fuel consumption for transportation company

        Things need to be considered prior to developing Monitoring and Measuring parameters:
            What needs to be monitored and measured - Parameters of operational controls, monitoring of gas emissions in a process
            Methods for monitoring, measuring, analyses and evaluation need to be defined to get suitable results - Report for waste disposal and storage
            The frequency and timing of the monitoring - Daily measurement reports
            Responsible people for conducting, monitoring, and the corresponding measurements
            When the results be analyzed and evaluated and who will be the person in charge
                Weekly detailed analysis of daily reports - Environment Compliance Manager
                Monthly detailed evaluation - Monthly meetings
                
        The standard requires monitoring and measuring are documented as evidence
        A good practice is to have the process documented as a procedure 
        The procedure must include all the mentioned elements
        The time schedule, frequencies, tools and methods must also be included in the procedure
        
        Important because the result is the main input for the improvement of EMS

    Internal Audit [Clause 9.2]
        The clause requires companies to conduct the internal audit at planned intervals
        The internal audit is to provide information whether if the EMS is fulfilling the requirements for environmental protection and to continually improve the EMS
        The standard also requires companies to establish the internal audit program (An annual schedule of internal audits)
        The scope of the audit also must be defined (What processes and departments will be audited)
        The scope of the audit should be documented in Internal Audit program 

        Before the audit starts, determine the criteria against which the audit will be conducted (ISO14001, contract obligations, interested party requirements)
        The company must select the auditors to conduct the audit - But take note to avoid conflict of interest (Auditor cannot audit his own work)
        The auditor must also be familiar with the standard and the auditing techniques (Achieved through training)
        Create plan for the internal audit although the document is not mandatory
        With documented plan, the auditor will avoid missing the details and easier to communicate the audit information

        To define the audit plan, determine the amount of time will be spent in each process, department and roles 
        Audit can be conducted by the single auditor or a team
        The results must be presented to the top management in the form of documented internal audit report
        The report includes general observations of the auditor, nonconformities, good practices and recommendations

    Management Review [Clause 9.3]
        Requiremments for top management to review the EMS at planned intervals
        This is to ensure that the EMS is suitable, adequate and effective
        Adequacy means the requirements of ISO14001 are met and the EMS is implemented appropriately
        The top management does not have to define operational controls but must know what is going on in the EMS
            Example: Whether or not every employees is perfroming their duties OR if the EMS is achieving the intended results
        The management must also make decisions regarding the following:
            The actions from previous management review (ie. last review was to train 3 more auditors, then the management should check if this was implemented and the results)
            Changes in internal and external issues relevant to the EMS
            Changes in needs and expectations of interested parties - (i.e Local authority requires increase in requirements regarding EMS)
            Changes regarding significant environmental aspects - Aspects should be reassessed regularly and changes be addressed properly
            Changes in risks and opportunities - (ie. Local authority decides to finance introduction of new technologies to improve energy efficiency)
            Level of achievement of objectives - 
                When objectives are met, the management should introduce new objectives, 
                If not met, then corrective actions must be performed in order to find its root cause to ensure the objectives will be met in the future
            Information on performance evaluation (Nonconformities, corrective actions, monitoring, measurements, fulfillment of compliance obligations, audit results and resource adequacy)
            Opportunities for improving the EMS (ie automation of the CO2 emissions monitoring)
        Review of the EMS is performed through a meeting and such meeting should be held at least once a year
        
        ISO14001 requires to keep documented results from the management review as evidence
        Usually after the meeting, the output will be documented in management review minutes or report
        Mandatory output includes:
            Conclusion and adequacy, suitability and effectiveness of EMS
            Decisions about continual improvement of the EMS
            Decisions related to the changes in the EMS
            Actions when the objectives havent been met
            Opportunities to improve the integration of EMS with other business activities - Raising awareness or altering processes and controls
            Any implication to strategic direction of the company - Top management must consider how the global strategy of the company affects the EMS or vice versa

    Nonconformities and Corrective Actions [Clause 10.1]
        Nonconformities is when a certain requirement is not complied with 
        The requirement may be the standard itself, the relevant legisltaion, the EMS documentation, and the requirements of interested parties
        Nonconformities and Corrective actions are important because they enable companies to identify oversights, mistakes, errors and deal with them effectively
        Nonconformities can be identified by anyone at any time

        Corrective actions are formal ways for resolving nonconformities
        Companies are required to document the evidence and the nature of the nonconformities, the corrective actions taken, and the results of the corrective actions
        The record is called the corrective action form
        The company should also check if the root cause is really being resolved
        The results and effect should be evaluated
        It is a good practice to document the procedure for nonconformities and corrective actions
        The procedure defines the steps for 
            Analyzing the nonconformities, 
            Initiating corrective actions, 
            Assigning responsibilities for corrective actions
            How to document and evaluate the effectiveness of teh corrective actions
        The standard requires the company to take the following actions when nonconformities occurs
            Control and correct the nonconformity and deal with the consequences
            Evaluate the need to eliminate the cause of nonconformity to prevent its reoccurrence
            Implement relevant actions - conducting new audit with newly trained auditors
            Review the effectiveness of the corrective action
            Make changes to the EMS if needed

    Continual Improvement [Clause 10.2]
        Continual improvement is an integral part of ISO14001
        The standard requires companies to continually improve the adequacy, suitability, and the effectiveness of its EMS
        The theory behind the standard implies that everything changees and it affects the EMS, hence the stress on adequacy and suitability than effectiveness
        The EMS must change to reflect the changes in the environment to respond to new threats and also to seize new opportunities
        Improvement opportunities may vary depending on the type of business and the maturity of the EMS
        Examples of improvement initiatives
            Implement software tools to support operational control processes and documntation activities
            Implement new modalities of awareness raising in the company
        Every improvement requires changes in the EMS BUT not every change brings the improvement
