    What is ISO14001
        An international standard that prescribes the requirements for establishing the Environmental Management System (EMS)
        Main part of the standard consists of 11 clauses
        Clause 0-3 are not really important (Description of standards)
        Clause 4-10 prescribes the requirements

    Structure
        Clause 0 - Gives the general overview of the standard and its compatibility with other standard
        Clause 1 - Scope - Defines the scope of the standard (States that ISO14001 is applicable to all types of organizations)
        Clause 2 - Normative Ref - Terms and definitions are given  in 14000
        Clause 3 - Terms and Condition - Terms and definitions are given  in 14000
        Clause 4 - Context of Organization - Gives the requirement for understanding the internal/external issues, interested parties and scope of EMS
        Clause 5 - Leadership - Defines responsibilities of top management to set the roles and responsibilities within EMS and establish environmental policy
        Clause 6 - Planning - Defines requirements for addressing risks/opportunities identification and evaluation of environmental aspects,
                              Compliance obligations, establishing environmental objectives and plans for achieving them
        Clause 7 - Support - Defines requirements for availibility of resources, competences, awareness, communication, and documented information
        Clause 8 - Operation - Defines requirements for operational planning&control AND emergency preparedness&response 
        Clause 9 - Performance evaluation - Defines requirements for measurements, monitoring, evaluation, analysis, internal audit and management review
        Clause 10 - Improvement - Requirements for nonconformities, corrective actions and continual improvements
        Annex A - Guidance on using ISO14001 - Only informative and doesnt add or change the standard
        Annex B - Correspondence between ISO14001:2015 and ISO14001:2004 - An overview of the relationship, also only informative

    Environmental Management System (EMS)
        A systematic approach to protecting the environment
        Enables organization to achieve intended results set in the EMS
        EMS represents a set of policies, procedures, operational control, and rules for environmental protection of company
        Environmental rules and controls that are to be implemented, will be decided based on the identification and evaluation of the environmental aspects
        Each environmental aspects consists of different combination of operational controls to be implemented (i.e toxic waste management)
        Important o show the employees what the best practices are and what they should observe
        
        Examples:
            Documenting a procedure is an operational control
            Introducing new technology to reduce toxic waste is an engineering control
            Training of employees is HR control

    Implementing ISO14001 requirements
        In order to be compliant, all requirements of the standard must be fulfilled
        ISO14001 is implemented and maintained through PDCA cycle, 
        
        Plan phase: 
            Understanding the context of the organization (i.e Dont do nuclear waste for paper factories)
            Define EMS scope
            Establish Environmental Policy
            Conducting identification and evaluation of environmental aspects 
            Identification of compliance obligations
            Planning operational controls
        Do phase: 
            Implementation of operational controls to fulfill the requirements set by EMS
            Achieving environmental objectives
            Regular reassessment of environmental aspects
        Check phase:
            Regular monitoring - whether the result achieves the requirement set in Plan phase 
            Internal audits
            Management reviews
        Act phase: 
            Fine tuning the process (Closing the gap between Crrent results and Planned results) - Aka improvements
            Implementing corrective actions and improvement initiatives
        
    Implementing ISO14001 as a Project
        Form a team and assign them with concrete roles
        Project Manager - Coordinates the project for implementation
        Project team - People under the coordination of the project manager (documenting and implementing)
        Management representative - Responsible for maintaining the EMS and its continual improvement (Usually also the project manager)
        Top management - Supports the process by showing commitment, setting objectives, making decisions, providing resources (manpower, budget, etc)
        
    Documenting ISO14001 requirements
        Deciding which policies or procedures to document and to what level of details
        Each clause specifies if the requirement needs to be documented or not
        First check if the document is mandatory (ie. the organization shall retain documented information of ...)
        Criterias that are mandatory
            EMS, 
            Environmental policy, 
            Identification and evaluation of environmental aspects and methodology, 
            Compliance obligations, 
            Environmental objectives and plans to achieve them
            Records of training, skills, experience and qualifications
            Evidence of communications
            Operational control
            Emergency preparedness and response
            Monitoring and measurement
            Internal audit program and results
            Management review results
            Results of corrective actions
        Criterias to decide whether it is not mandatory
            Risks - check the aspect evaluation results to see if there is a need for such a control
            Size of the company - Smaller companies tend to have lesser documents (Avoid writing procedure for every small processes)
            Importance and complexity - The more complex or important the process is, the more likely to be documented
        ISO14001 does not specify what kind of documentation is required for operating the EMS - Free to tailor the documents according to its needs

    Benefits
        Improves company image and credibility - Helps improve community relationship hence improving the market share
        Helps organizations to comply with legal requirements - Provides framework for identifying, monitoring and complying with requirements
        Improves cost control - 
            Helps identify, control and reduce the number of environmental incidents
            Existence of improvement aspects of EMS to reduce costs by working to conserve energy and input materials required
            Higher rate of success when implementing changes - Usage of good and accurate data (Key aspects of the standard)
            Enable quicker improvement of processes - Continual improvement culture
            Reduce employee turnover - Employees engaged in other aspects of the company
