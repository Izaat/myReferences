                Supports the Black Belts by working on the project
                Dual role with performing designated day-to-day jobs

        #Organizational Drivers and Metrics
            Balanced Scorecard (BSC) offers strategic implementation and performance measurement
            BSC translates organizational strategy into actionable objectives
            BSC provides a framework for performance measurement

        #Balanced Scorecard:
            Helps clarify organizational vision and mission
            Provides feedback on business processes and external outcomes
            Enables continuous improvement with respect to organizational goals
            Integrates organizational strategy with key metrics from 4 major areas of performance (Four Box Model)
                Finance, 
                Customer Relations, 
                Internal Processes 
                Learning and growing

        #Developing BSC:
            Interactions between perspectives or business units have to onsidered to prevent uneven optimization.
                Strategic Objectives: 3 or 4 objectives have to be agreed upon >
                Measures to access progress (Should be closely related to performance drivers) >
                Targets for each measure > 
                Initiatives requires to achieve each target

        #Four box Model of BSC  
            Financial > Learning & Growth > Internal Processes > Customer > Repeat

        #Strategy Maps
            A chain of cause and effect relationships between the perspectives are represented by interlinked objectives in strategy map
            A one page view of how the organization can create value
            Function is to outline what the organization wants to accomplish and how it plans to accomplish

            Example Table:
            # Financial        | Lower cost     >  Increase Profitability   <     Increase Revenue
            #                  |      ^                                                 ^
            # Customer         |      ^            Lower wait Time          >     Improve Customer Retention
            #                  |      ^                                                 ^
            # Internal Process | Increase Process Efficiency                >     Lower Cycle Time
            #                  |      ^
            # Learn & Growth   |  Improve Knowledge, Tools and Technology

        #Impact on Organization
            BSC and strategy map forces managers to consider cause and effect relationships leading to >
                Better identification of drivers
                Well rounded approach to strategic planning
            BSC improves:
                Communications and understandings at all levels of organization
                Quality of decision making by managing information
                Structured approach to reporting progress by creating performance reports against a balanced scorecard
                Enables organization to communicate performance transparently and meaningfully
                BSCs can be cascaded into each business unit enabling direction to work towards the common organizational goal

    #Lean Principles
        #The 3 Focuses
            Muda: Non-value added work
            Mura: UnevennessVariations
            Muri: Overburden

        #Muda - The 7 types of Wastes
            Transport
            Inventory
            Motion
            People: 
            Waiting            
            Overprocessing
            Overproduction            
            Defects/Repairs/Rejects
            
            Other wastes:
                Underutilization of skills and manpower
                    Not assigning right people for the right task
                    Below optimum use of workforce capabilities
                Underperforming processes
                    Automation of poorly performing processes
                    Improving a process that should be eliminated
                    Asymmetry in processes that should be eliminated

        #Lean Process Steps:
            Identify what customers wants
            Understand what the process should have to meet customer requirements

        #Pull vs Push Process
            Push Method (Pharmacy)
                Forecast demand
                Build stock
                Wait for customers to buy
            Pull Method (Tesla Motors)
                Get customer demand
                Start production
                Deliver to customer

        #Theory of Constraints
            Question:
                The 3 subprocess of packing process: Print > Filling > Sealing
                Data for 3 subprocesses measured and collected as number of units produced per hour
                    Print: 900 pc/hr
                    Fill: 720 pc/hr
                    Seal: 780 pc/hr
                How to implement TOC Method?
                
            Answer:
                TOC Map: 5 steps pie
                    Step 1: Filling is the constraint since it's the lowest number
                    Step 2: Performance of constaint is then analyzed by data 
                        Assigning repair and maintenance labor force monitor
                    Step 3: Carry out the maintenance of filling machine
                    Step 4: Remove defects from filling machine
                    Step 5: Repeat to step one and identify system constraint

                Before TOC
                    Print: 900 pc/hr
                    Fill : 720 pc/hr
                    Seal : 780 pc/hr
                    
                After TOC
                    Print: 900 pc/hr
                    Fill : 840 pc/hr
                    Seal : 780 pc/hr

        #IDOV VS DMADV
            IDOV
                Used for designing new product/service
                Design new process
            DMADV
                Used for designing new or existing product/service
                Redesign existing process

        #QFD (Quality Function Deployment) / VOC (Voice of Customer) / HOQ (House of Quality)
            A predefined method of identifyingcustomerrequirements
            A systematic process to understand the needs of customer and convert them into a set of design and manufactureing requirements
            Motivates businesses to focus on customers 
            Helps design products that are competitive in lesser time and cost
            Identifies which customer's needs are the most important
            Identifies strangths and weaknesses of the system
            
            Necessary to ask customers relevant questions and tabulate a set of parameters critical to the product design as data
            Required to understand the effects of failures to ensure preventive actions are taken to be able to answer to the customer
        
        #FMEA
            Helps focus attention on critical areas in a system
            Drawbacks of FMEA is that it does not give solutions to the identified problem
            Applied on the output of root cause analysis
            Tool for focus or prioritization
            
            #PFMEA
                Used onnew orexisting process to uncover potential failures
                Done in the quality planning phase to act as an aid during production
                Involves fabrication, assembly, transactions or services
                
            #DFMEA
                Used in design of a new product to uncover potential failures
                Aimed at identifying failures and reduce them
                Done before product is sent to manufacturing
                All design deficiencies would be resolved at the end of this process

            #RPN (Risk priority Number)
                The higher the number, the higher the criticality
                RPN = Severity x Occurences x Detectability
                Max value = 1000
                
            #Severity
                How severe the failure is to the customer

            #Occurence 
                The probability that a cause will result in the particular failure mode

            #Detection
                The probability that a particular symptom to failure will be found 
                Max value = 10 = Undetectable/Uncertainty

02. Define Phase

    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    #Project Identification
        #Prerequisites of a project
            01. Is there an existing process
            02. Is there a problem in the process
            03. Is the problem measureable: 
                This is needed since data is needed to assess the root cause
                And the impact of the problem
            04. Does the problem impact customer satisfaction
            05. Does working on the problem impact the profits of the company
            06. Is the root cause of the problem unknown
                IF the root cause is visible, it is not required to do a six sigma project
            07. Is the solution unknown
                If the solution is know, there is no need for the project

        #Define Phase Objectives
            Define problem statement through customer Analysis
            Define the objectives of the Project
            Plan time, budget and resource requirements for the project
            Define roles and responsibilities in the team structure

        #Benchmarking
            A process of comparing an organization's business processes, practices and performance metrics with industry leaders
            Types of benchmarking
                Process benchmark: Compare with a leading company
                Financial benchmark: Detailed financial analysis and compare on overall competitiveness and produtivity
                Performance benchmark: Compare products and services with the competitors
                Product benchmark: Designing new or upgrading existing product/services. Involves reverse engineering of their products.
                Strategic benchmark: Studying strategies and problem solving approaches in other industries
                Functional benchmark: Focused analysis of a single function with the aim of improving it
                Competitive benchmark: Standardizing organizational strategies, process, products, services, procedures with competitors
                Collaborative benchmark: Standards carried out by a group of companies where information is shared
            Best Practices
                A method that ensures continuous improvement, leading to exceptional performance
                Increase the objectives or scope of benchmarking
                Set standards and path to be followed at the initial stage
                Reduce unnecessary effort and comply with scope
                Recognize the best in the industry to set a benchmark
                Share the information derived from benchmarking

            Business System > Business Process > Process
                Business System:
                    Value added chain of various business processes
                    Example: The company
                Business Process:
                    Systematic organization of objects into work activities to produce service/product
                    The manufacturing department under a company
                Process:
                    Series of steps to produce a service or product
                    Consists of input, process, and output
                    Manufacturing Cell Team under the manufacturing department 

            Challenges of Business Process Improvement
                The traditional business system structure causes challenges on business process improvement
                Product or service has to go through various functions and their functional elements to reach the customer
                Management of the flow of products or services across various functional elements is difficult

            Hierarchy:
                Process Owner > Stakeholder > 
                    Stockholders
                    Customers
                    Suppliers
                    Management
                    Employees
                    Society
                    
                Process Owner   
                    Responsible for the performance and execution of the process
                
                Stakeholder:
                    People who are affected by the organization's actions

            Effects of Process Failure on Stakeholders
                Failure to meet one or more process objectives results in negative effects on stakeholders
                Stockholders:   Reduction in perceived value for the company
                Customers:      May seek competitor's product and find legal recourse
                Suppliers:         May face delay in receiving their pay or non-payment issues
                Management:  May require cost cut-down
                Employees:      Will receive diminishing wages
                Society:            May experience pollution due to the organization

            Stakeholder Analysis
                An important task to be completed before doing a Six Sigma project
                A business has many stakeholders and anny change to a business process affects some or all of them
                When a process does not meet its objectives, it results in a stakeholders being negatively affected, 
                    which in turn impacts the organization's performance
                The Six Sigma team must factor in the reasons why a stakeholder may oppose the change effort

    #Customers: 2 types of customers
        Internal
        External
        
        Internal Customers
            Anyone within the business system who is affected by the product or services while it is being developed
            Activities that directly impact final customers
            Activities that directly affect the next process in the system
            Activities that affects the quality of the end product

        Collecting customer data/feedback
            Data/Feedbacks is collected from internal and external customers
            It fills the gaps and improve the various business processes in the organization
            Helps to define a good quality product as perceived by the customer
            Identifies what qualities make the competitior's products or service better
            Identifies the factors that provide a competitive edge to the product or service
            
            Method:
                Surveys
                Focus Groups
                Individual interviews
                Direct feedback (emails, forms, call centre data, etc)

        Translate Customer Requirements
            Data collected from customers that gives information on what they need or want from the process
            Are often high level, vague and non-specific. But a reflection of their experience
            When translated into critical process requirements that are specific and measureable, they are called Critical To Quality (CTQ) factors
            
        The 4 elements of CTQ (Critical To Quality)
            Output characteristis
            Y metrics
            Targets
            Specification/tolerance limits

        QFD (Quality Function deployment)
            A process to understand the customer's needs
            Translates customer's needs into a set of design and manufacturing reuirements
            Motivates businesses to focus on customers
            Helps to design and build more competitive products in lesser time at lower cost
            Helps recognize strength and weaknesses of the organization
            Helps understand areas where most of the work is to be done
            Helps to understand where the focus should be
            
        QFD Phases:
            #Phase 1 :  Customer requirements     >         Product Planning        >           Technical requirements

            Project Scope
                Interpreted from problem statement and project charter
                Tools used for interpretation of project scope:
                    Pareto Chart:
                        Assists to narrow the scope of the project by indentifying the causes that have major impact on the outcomes
                    SIPOC:
                        A high level process map which helps to understand the process functions at the supplier, input, process, output and customer level

        #Process Maps
            A micro level flow chart that provides an in-depth detail of a process
            The process map covers details at all levels 
            Provides a walk through experience (From supplier to eternal customer)
            Used as a blueprint while drawing a process map
            Final process map drills further into details

            Process/Consequential Metrics
                Measures the negative effects of improving the primary or the key metrics
                Used for measuring indemnity triggered by any damage in the project
                Inconsistent use of  consequential metrics can lead to a loss of opportunity and rework after project ends
                Helps to understand the cause and effect relationship between the primary and the secondary metrics and the impact on organization

            Consequential Metrics - Best Practices
                Using consequential metrics during measure phase  and monitor after project finalization
                    Helps to analyze whether the link between previous primary and secondary metrics has been established
                Consequential metrics + Primary metrics + Secondary metrics = Provides clarity  
                Assessing and evaluating the cause and effect relationship between these metrics helps the organization

            Project Planning Tools
                Pareto Chart
                Network Diagrams
                CPM - Critical Path Method
                PERT - Program Evaluationn and Review Technique

            Pareto Chart (80/20 Rule)
                A histogram depicting the frequency of occurences
                Plots all causes for defets in a product or service
                80% of effects comes from 20% of causes
                Narrows the scope of the project/problem solving by identifying the major causes

            Network Diagrams/Arrow Diagram
                A diagram that uses arrows to connect activities and represent precedence and interdependencies between activities of a project
                Assumptions made while drawing the Network Diagram:
                    Before new activity begines, all pending activities have been completed
                    The direction of arrow represents teh sequence that activities need to follow
                    Must start from a single evene and end with a single event
                
                Terms
                To calculate the total duration of the project, four dates for each task must be defined
                    Early Start: Earliest start date of task
                    Late Start: Last date by when the task should start
                    Early Finish: Earliest date the task can be completed
                    Late Finish: Last date the task should be completed

                Duration of Task
                    Difference between the early start and early finish of the task
                    Slack Start Time = Late Start - Early start
                    Slack Finish Time = Late Finish - Early Finish

                CPM - Critical Path Method
                    Used to monitor the progress of a project and ensure that the project is on schedule
                    The longest sequence of tasks on the network diagram
                    Tasks on the critical path have zero slack
                    Resources from tasks that are not on critical path can be diverted to critical task path (To prevent delay)

        #Project Evaluation and Review Techniques - Risks
            An uncertain event or consequence that will probably occur during a project
            Impacts at least one of 4 main objectives (Time, Cost, Quality, Scope)
            Positive risks enhance the success of the project
            Negative risks pose a threat to a project's success
            
            Terms:
                Risk Probability       : Likelihood that a risk will occur. Assessing risk is assessing probability and impact of the risk
                Issue                       : The occurence of risk
                Risk Consequences: Effects on project objectives if there is an occurence of a risk or issue

            #Elements
                Qualitative method - Interviews, checklists, brainstrming - used to identify risks
                Quantitative method - Evaluate the cost, time and probabilisti combination of individual uncertainties
                Feasibility - The study of project risk
                Potential Impact - Determining the impact of potential risks on a project
                RPN - Probability of occurence, severity and detectability
                Avoiding Risk - If the potential impact is huge, then avoiding is the best option
                Mitigating risk - Loss from mitigating a risk is much less than loss from temporarily avoiding the risk
                Accepting risk - If risk cannot be avoided or mitigated, then it has to be accepted (If it doesnt greatly impact cost, time and product objective)

            #Risk assessment matrix

            #Project Closure
                Without formal closure process, project team can fail to recognize the end and the project will drag on at great expense
                Each phase of the project must have closure process
                Outcomes:
                    Outcomes match the stated goals of the project
                    Customers and stakeholders are happy with the results
                    Critical knowledge is captured
                    Team feels a sense of completion
                    Project resources are released for new projects
                Closure Report Goals:
                    Review and validate the success of the project
                    Confirm outstanding issues, limitations and recommendations
                    Outline tasks and activities accompanied to complete the activity
                    Highlight the best practices for future projects
                    Provide the project report/summary
                    Provide project background overview

        #PDPC - Process Decision Program Chart
            Used for charting the course of events from the beginning of a process to the final goal
            Used before implementing a plan
            Used in case the plan must be completed on schedule
            Used when the price of failure is high
            
        #Activity Network Diagram
            To show the time required for solving a problem
            To identify items that can be done in parallel
            Used for scheduling and monitor tasks with complex project OR process with interrelated tasks and resources
            The diagram defines: 
                the amount of time for each operation
                the relation of work without time for each operation
                each specific operation
            Diagram:
                Contains nodes where each node represents the steps of sub operation
                Arrows between nodes represents the time taken

    #Business Results for Projects
        #Throughput Yield (TPY)
            Only be used to measure single process
            The number of acceptable pieces at the end of a process divided by the number of start pieces
            The start pieces excludes scrap and rework

        #If DPU (Defects pr unit) is known, TPY can be calculated
            TPY = e^-DPU    (e to the power of -DPU)
            DPU = -loge (TPY), where e = 2.7183

        #Rolled Throughput Yield (RTY)
            Probability of the entire process producing zero defects
            Important as a metric when a process has excessive rework
            A measure of efficency
        
            TDPU (Total Defects per Unit) defined for a set of processes
                RTY = e^-TDPU (e to the power of -TDPU)
                TDPU = -loge(RTY)
            
            RTY is the product of FPY (First Pass Yield) when the defects are known
            FPY is the number of products which pass without any reork over total number of units 
                FPY = (Total Units - Defects) / Total Units
                       = Total Quality Unit / Total Units
                       
                RTY = FPY1 * FPY2 * FPY3 * ... * FPYn

        #Cp - Process Capability
            Inherent variability of a characteristic of a process or product
            An indicator of the capability of a process
            Sigma is the standard deviation of a process
            Cp = (USL-LSL) / 6sigma
            Difference between USL and LSL is called Specification width or Tolerance
