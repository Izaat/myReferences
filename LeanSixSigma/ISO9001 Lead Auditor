    Auditor Assumptions
        Auditor may expect to see the Quality manual, although a useful document but it's not a mandatory document for auditors to check
        Determine what the real requirements are - Usually done during the document review phase
        Just because something is different, doesnt mean it does not comply with the requirements
        NOTE: Know the difference between the Quality Policy and Quality Manual. Quality Policies are mandatory to exist
        
    3 methods for finding evidence
        Review the documents and records
            Asking for them from the auditee and reading them thoroughly
            It's the auditee's responsibility to find the procedures (Note that non-mandatory documents wont be available)
            Verify nonconformance by checking the process or activity
        Interviewing the employees
            If there is no record or procedure, then interview the employees for the method
            Interview a few employees because one employee will not give a solid proof
            If they give different answers, it proves that the process is not defined or untrained
        Observation of facilities and activities
            In some cases, you will have to observe the activities and facilities together with reading the documents and records and interviewing the employees
            This method can sometime be the only way to check whether or not the company is  complying with its own procedures and standards
            Visiting the production facility to check how a particular process is carried out
            Determine the process is compliant with the procedure and whther it fits the statements of the employees

        NOTE: Audit team shouldn't go beyond the scope of the audit during the onsite audit

    Sampling the Records
        Sometimes it's not possible to read all the records especially for large corporations
        Find the most relevant records or records for the most complex process
        Also focus on training records of employees who are involved in this process - primarily new employees
        New employees tend to have higher chance of not being properly trained
        Don't let the auditee provide you with the records of their choice

    Interviewing Techniques
        Interviewing people is the most difficult way of finding evidence but the best way to find out how the company operates
        Use open ended questions (ie. questions starting with the phrase "Please describe")
        Close ended question should be avoided (Short answers - ie. Y/N answers)
        Find out the root cause of the problem by asking the 5 whys

    Audit findings
        2 outcomes - Nonconformities/Observations
        Nonconformities: Raised when auditor finds the proof that something is wrong
        Observations: Raised when auditor cant thinks something is wrong and has no evidence to back it up
        Outcomes must be documented in the internal audit report
        
    Nonconformities
        When a certain requirement is not complied
        Requirements:
            ISO9001 standard itself
            Quality Policies and procedures - complying with internal rules
            Requirements of interested parties - Client requirements for quality
            NOTE: If there is no requirement, nonconformity cannot be raised

    Observations
        Raised when there is no solid proof when there is nonconformity
        Observations can be both negative or positive

    Internal Audit vs External Audit
        External Audits are done by the certification body or external companies
        Internal audits are done by the employees or contractors employed by the company

    Annual Audit Program
        Assuring information security and confidentiality
        The period audits will be planned (1 to 3 years)
        The period audits will be conducted
            Once for the entire small company or number of times depending on number of departments for lager companies
        Scope of each audit - Define precisely what each audit will cover, A single complex process can be subdivided into multiple audits
        Checking compliance with legal requirements can also be defined
        Audit criteria
            ISO9001 standards
            Documentations
            3rd party requirements for QMS
        Define which method will be used for auditing
            Doc review, interviews, observation of activities
        Who will be performing the audit - One person or a team, 
            Put emphasis on parts of the company that are more important in terms of quality or higher risks
        Take into account previous audit results
            Going for the department that has lower audit score and conducting more detailed checks

    Audit Plan for an Individual audit
        ISO9001 does not specify what should be included in the audit plan
        Audit plan is not mandatory
        List of all the departments or elements of the QMS you plan to audit in this individual audit
            -Organize the audit department by department or clause by clause
        Timing for each of these items (i.e HR at 9am, Production at 11am, etc)
        Contact persons for each of the item in the list
        If more than 1 auditor, specify who will audit what. Lead auditors should be included in internal audit procedure, not audit plan
        Objectives, criteria and methods from the Audit program can be copied
        Audit plan doesn't need to contain questions to be asked during the audit (Questions should be in internal audit checklist instead)

    Creation of checklist
        Purpose is to remind what needed to be done during the audit
        But the problem during the audit is that auditors need to speak to alot of people for various evidences, clauses, policies and procedures
        All that is impossible without the reminder or list
        Checklist will be created during the document review - Take note of what needed to be check during the review
        Might drive the auditor in one direction and miss some newly discovered leads that havent been planned in the checklist
        Example, while process being performed correctly, you might miss that top management didn't provide enough resources to resolve nonconformities
        Best approach is to have one document with 4 columns
            > Clause
            > Description of requirements
            > Compliance: Y/N
            > Notes

    Internal Audit Report
        A mandatory document according to ISO9001
        Results are to be stored for few years
        3 parts of the report
            > General: Dates, name, which part of the company being audited, audit criteria, other general information
            > Nonconformities found
            > Observations
        Doesnt have to be a detailed report but it needs to be precise
        Report should be issued and distributed as defined in the audit plan/procedure

    Corrective Action follow up
        It is not enough to write corrective actio request. 
        As internal auditor, follow up and make sure it is completed
        Also check  the corrective action form as this will provide an insight of what has been done
        Make sure that the root cause of nonconformity was resolved
        The follow up will be some kind of small audit focused on this nonconformity
        Conduct follow up check within 1 month

    Recording of Evidence
        Internal audit records need to be produced as it is a mandatory document
        It is crucial for internal auditor to write everything being heard or discovered
        Include date, version number, record names, serial number
        For interviews, write the name of the interviewee, job title, date and time and exact quotes that are relevant
        For observation of the facilities and processes, write the exact rooms, location, date and time, description of what being discovered
        Write all the evidence in the internal audit checklist

    What is certification
        Certification is a voluntary decision that can be made by any organization that they are complying with the management system standards
        Certification are offered by certification bodies which in turn accredited by the accreditation body
        Certification are offered to any organization of any size
        Auditors are the people who will conduct the audit on behalf of the certification body
        Auditors must have experience of the type of organization that they are auditing
        Auditors must have the competency in the standard being audited, auditing process and training or experience in auditing management systems
        Certification bodies need to develop their processes to ensure their auditors are competent
        Auditors' competency is a big part of what accreditation bodies will check

    Certification Process
        Certification process starts with an "implementation project" to ensure they meet the requirements of the standard
        This also develops the processes and documentation needed
        The company will then choose which certification body will conduct the certification audits
        Certification bodies are actually commercial businesses offering different rates and services
        The certification body will collect information about their clients and decide how many audits are necessary and decide the audit program
        They will also conduct "Gap analysis audit" which is an additional audit and not part of the certification process
        2 stages of Initial certification process:            
            Find out which part of the standard and process needs to be improved
                Check if there are any basic framework and process in place
            Test the implementation of the organizations' management system
                Check if the last audit being fixed
                Assess if the organization has met all the requirements and standards
            NOTE: 
                If the nonconformities are not major nonconformances, they can still be awarded the certificate
                Organizations do also need to show the certification body that they will make the required improvements
        The certificate is valid for 3 years but the organization will continue to be audited at regular intervals during the period
            1st Contact > Gap Analysis > Stage 1 > Stage 2 > Recommendation for Cert > Surveillance > Recertification
            Stage 1 -> Stage 2 -> Surveillance Audits -> Recertification Audit

    Certification of integrated management systems
        An organization may have combination of ISO standards. I.e 9001, 14001, 50001
        In the case of organizations with combined standards, certification body may conduct a integrated management system audit
        The auditors will assess that the management system requirements for each standard are being achieved
        Since there are overlaps between the management systems, the total number of audit days are lesser compared to separate audits
        The organization only has to organize 1 audit program to caover the integrated management system

    Accreditation and ISO17021
        ISO17021:2015 is a standard certification bodies need to meet to achieve accreditation
        Accreditation are independent or government regulated bodies
        The accredited status gives the certification bodies the right to issue formal certificates
        ISO17021-1 covers the requirements for all certification body audits 
        Accreditation process involves 
            An audit of the certification body's management system
            Witnessed audits to assess the competency of lead auditors
            Application of the certification body's processes
        Accreditation body will not be there to audit the audit client, but to audit the certification body's work
        ISO17021-1 covers:
            Clause 4 - Audit Principles
            Clause 9 - Audit Processes
            Annexes - Auditor Competencies and Evaluation methods
            Ramaining clauses - 
                Auditors, 
                Auditing Processes, 
                Management Systems 
                    Certification issuance, 
                    Confidentiality management, 
                    Conflict of interest, 
                    Appeals and complains management
        ISO17021-1 Topics:
            Audit Principles
            Audit Program
            Audit Delivery
            Auditor competency and evaluation
            
    Competencies of Lead Auditors required by ISO17021-1
        Requires certification bodies to establish competency criteria, evaluation methods and competency development processes
        Requires auditors to acquire general knowledge and skills (Found in Annex A)
            Knowledge of audit principles, practices, and techniques that apply to all management system audits
            Knowledge of the processes and procedures of the certification body
            Knowledge of the specific sector's business operations, products, processes and organization
            Knowledge of general business management practices, for different types of businesses
            Presentation skills, note taking and report writing
            Interviewing skills
            Audit management skills
            Sufficient language skills
         NOTE: There are also further defined skills in other standards in ISO17021 series 
            ISO17021-2 for ISO14001
            ISO17021-3 for ISO9001

    International Accreditation Forum (IAF) Documents
        Is an association for the various accreditation bodies around the world/
        Its aim is to bring about coordination and assimilation between different accreditation bodies involved in conformity assessments
        Accreditation bodies that signed the IAF Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) agreed to recognize other accreditations
        IAF pulblishes various documents including mandatory documents used by accreditation bodies when auditing certification bodies
        Useful for certification bodies and lead auditors as they give more details on how to implement the requirements of ISO17021-1
        The mandatory documents cover topic such as:
            How to calculate audit duration for certification audits
            How to develop a multisite audit program and sampling process
            The evaluation of auditor competencies
        Other documents includes 
            Guidance Documents
            Informative Documents

    ISO19011
        A standard that doesn't need to be used by lead auditors undertaking certification audits
        Does not replace the use of ISO17021-1
        A guidance for lead auditors hence it is optional
        Not possible to acieve certification against ISO19011
        Organizations often choose to use this as a guidance for their internal audit processes and auditing of management systems
        
    Principles of Auditing
        ISO17021-1 and ISO19011 contains information on auditing
        ISO17021-1  principles apply mainly the the way  the certification body operates
        ISO19011 principles apply more to the behavior of the auditors 
            First principle: Integrity, honesty, transparency
            Second principle: Fair presentation
            Third principle: Professional care
            Fourth principle: Confidentiality
            Fifth principle: Conflict of Interest
