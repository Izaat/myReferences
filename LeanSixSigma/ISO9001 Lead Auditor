    Auditor Assumptions
        Auditor may expect to see the Quality manual, although a useful document but it's not a mandatory document for auditors to check
        Determine what the real requirements are - Usually done during the document review phase
        Just because something is different, doesnt mean it does not comply with the requirements
        NOTE: Know the difference between the Quality Policy and Quality Manual. Quality Policies are mandatory to exist
        
    3 methods for finding evidence
        Review the documents and records
            Asking for them from the auditee and reading them thoroughly
            It's the auditee's responsibility to find the procedures (Note that non-mandatory documents wont be available)
            Verify nonconformance by checking the process or activity
        Interviewing the employees
            If there is no record or procedure, then interview the employees for the method
            Interview a few employees because one employee will not give a solid proof
            If they give different answers, it proves that the process is not defined or untrained
        Observation of facilities and activities
            In some cases, you will have to observe the activities and facilities together with reading the documents and records and interviewing the employees
            This method can sometime be the only way to check whether or not the company is  complying with its own procedures and standards
            Visiting the production facility to check how a particular process is carried out
            Determine the process is compliant with the procedure and whther it fits the statements of the employees

        NOTE: Audit team shouldn't go beyond the scope of the audit during the onsite audit

    Sampling the Records
        Sometimes it's not possible to read all the records especially for large corporations
        Find the most relevant records or records for the most complex process
        Also focus on training records of employees who are involved in this process - primarily new employees
        New employees tend to have higher chance of not being properly trained
        Don't let the auditee provide you with the records of their choice

    Interviewing Techniques
        Interviewing people is the most difficult way of finding evidence but the best way to find out how the company operates
        Use open ended questions (ie. questions starting with the phrase "Please describe")
        Close ended question should be avoided (Short answers - ie. Y/N answers)
        Find out the root cause of the problem by asking the 5 whys

    Audit findings
        2 outcomes - Nonconformities/Observations
        Nonconformities: Raised when auditor finds the proof that something is wrong
        Observations: Raised when auditor cant thinks something is wrong and has no evidence to back it up
        Outcomes must be documented in the internal audit report
        
    Nonconformities
        When a certain requirement is not complied
        Requirements:
            ISO9001 standard itself
            Quality Policies and procedures - complying with internal rules
            Requirements of interested parties - Client requirements for quality
            NOTE: If there is no requirement, nonconformity cannot be raised

    Observations
        Raised when there is no solid proof when there is nonconformity
        Observations can be both negative or positive

    Internal Audit vs External Audit
        External Audits are done by the certification body or external companies
        Internal audits are done by the employees or contractors employed by the company

    Annual Audit Program
        Assuring information security and confidentiality
        The period audits will be planned (1 to 3 years)
        The period audits will be conducted
            Once for the entire small company or number of times depending on number of departments for lager companies
        Scope of each audit - Define precisely what each audit will cover, A single complex process can be subdivided into multiple audits
        Checking compliance with legal requirements can also be defined
        Audit criteria
            ISO9001 standards
            Documentations
            3rd party requirements for QMS
        Define which method will be used for auditing
            Doc review, interviews, observation of activities
        Who will be performing the audit - One person or a team, 
            Put emphasis on parts of the company that are more important in terms of quality or higher risks
        Take into account previous audit results
            Going for the department that has lower audit score and conducting more detailed checks

    Audit Plan for an Individual audit
        ISO9001 does not specify what should be included in the audit plan
        Audit plan is not mandatory
        List of all the departments or elements of the QMS you plan to audit in this individual audit
            -Organize the audit department by department or clause by clause
        Timing for each of these items (i.e HR at 9am, Production at 11am, etc)
        Contact persons for each of the item in the list
        If more than 1 auditor, specify who will audit what. Lead auditors should be included in internal audit procedure, not audit plan
        Objectives, criteria and methods from the Audit program can be copied
        Audit plan doesn't need to contain questions to be asked during the audit (Questions should be in internal audit checklist instead)

    Creation of checklist
        Purpose is to remind what needed to be done during the audit
        But the problem during the audit is that auditors need to speak to alot of people for various evidences, clauses, policies and procedures
        All that is impossible without the reminder or list
        Checklist will be created during the document review - Take note of what needed to be check during the review
        Might drive the auditor in one direction and miss some newly discovered leads that havent been planned in the checklist
        Example, while process being performed correctly, you might miss that top management didn't provide enough resources to resolve nonconformities
        Best approach is to have one document with 4 columns
            > Clause
            > Description of requirements
            > Compliance: Y/N
            > Notes

    Internal Audit Report
        A mandatory document according to ISO9001
        Results are to be stored for few years
        3 parts of the report
            > General: Dates, name, which part of the company being audited, audit criteria, other general information
            > Nonconformities found
            > Observations
        Doesnt have to be a detailed report but it needs to be precise
        Report should be issued and distributed as defined in the audit plan/procedure

    Corrective Action follow up
        It is not enough to write corrective actio request. 
        As internal auditor, follow up and make sure it is completed
        Also check  the corrective action form as this will provide an insight of what has been done
        Make sure that the root cause of nonconformity was resolved
        The follow up will be some kind of small audit focused on this nonconformity
        Conduct follow up check within 1 month

    Recording of Evidence
        Internal audit records need to be produced as it is a mandatory document
        It is crucial for internal auditor to write everything being heard or discovered
        Include date, version number, record names, serial number
        For interviews, write the name of the interviewee, job title, date and time and exact quotes that are relevant
        For observation of the facilities and processes, write the exact rooms, location, date and time, description of what being discovered
        Write all the evidence in the internal audit checklist

    What is certification
        Certification is a voluntary decision that can be made by any organization that they are complying with the management system standards
        Certification are offered by certification bodies which in turn accredited by the accreditation body
        Certification are offered to any organization of any size
        Auditors are the people who will conduct the audit on behalf of the certification body
        Auditors must have experience of the type of organization that they are auditing
        Auditors must have the competency in the standard being audited, auditing process and training or experience in auditing management systems
        Certification bodies need to develop their processes to ensure their auditors are competent
        Auditors' competency is a big part of what accreditation bodies will check

    Certification Process
        Certification process starts with an "implementation project" to ensure they meet the requirements of the standard
        This also develops the processes and documentation needed
        The company will then choose which certification body will conduct the certification audits
        Certification bodies are actually commercial businesses offering different rates and services
        The certification body will collect information about their clients and decide how many audits are necessary and decide the audit program
        They will also conduct "Gap analysis audit" which is an additional audit and not part of the certification process
        2 stages of Initial certification process:            
            Find out which part of the standard and process needs to be improved
                Check if there are any basic framework and process in place
            Test the implementation of the organizations' management system
                Check if the last audit being fixed
                Assess if the organization has met all the requirements and standards
            NOTE: 
                If the nonconformities are not major nonconformances, they can still be awarded the certificate
                Organizations do also need to show the certification body that they will make the required improvements
        The certificate is valid for 3 years but the organization will continue to be audited at regular intervals during the period
            1st Contact > Gap Analysis > Stage 1 > Stage 2 > Recommendation for Cert > Surveillance > Recertification
            Stage 1 -> Stage 2 -> Surveillance Audits -> Recertification Audit

    Certification of integrated management systems
        An organization may have combination of ISO standards. I.e 9001, 14001, 50001
        In the case of organizations with combined standards, certification body may conduct a integrated management system audit
        The auditors will assess that the management system requirements for each standard are being achieved
        Since there are overlaps between the management systems, the total number of audit days are lesser compared to separate audits
        The organization only has to organize 1 audit program to caover the integrated management system

    Accreditation and ISO17021
        ISO17021:2015 is a standard certification bodies need to meet to achieve accreditation
        Accreditation are independent or government regulated bodies
        The accredited status gives the certification bodies the right to issue formal certificates
        ISO17021-1 covers the requirements for all certification body audits 
        Accreditation process involves 
            An audit of the certification body's management system
            Witnessed audits to assess the competency of lead auditors
            Application of the certification body's processes
        Accreditation body will not be there to audit the audit client, but to audit the certification body's work
        ISO17021-1 covers:
            Clause 4 - Audit Principles
            Clause 9 - Audit Processes
            Annexes - Auditor Competencies and Evaluation methods
            Ramaining clauses - 
                Auditors, 
                Auditing Processes, 
                Management Systems 
                    Certification issuance, 
                    Confidentiality management, 
                    Conflict of interest, 
                    Appeals and complains management
        ISO17021-1 Topics:
            Audit Principles
            Audit Program
            Audit Delivery
            Auditor competency and evaluation
            
    Competencies of Lead Auditors required by ISO17021-1
        Requires certification bodies to establish competency criteria, evaluation methods and competency development processes
        Requires auditors to acquire general knowledge and skills (Found in Annex A)
            Knowledge of audit principles, practices, and techniques that apply to all management system audits
            Knowledge of the processes and procedures of the certification body
            Knowledge of the specific sector's business operations, products, processes and organization
            Knowledge of general business management practices, for different types of businesses
            Presentation skills, note taking and report writing
            Interviewing skills
            Audit management skills
            Sufficient language skills
         NOTE: There are also further defined skills in other standards in ISO17021 series 
            ISO17021-2 for ISO14001
            ISO17021-3 for ISO9001

    International Accreditation Forum (IAF) Documents
        Is an association for the various accreditation bodies around the world/
        Its aim is to bring about coordination and assimilation between different accreditation bodies involved in conformity assessments
        Accreditation bodies that signed the IAF Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) agreed to recognize other accreditations
        IAF pulblishes various documents including mandatory documents used by accreditation bodies when auditing certification bodies
        Useful for certification bodies and lead auditors as they give more details on how to implement the requirements of ISO17021-1
        The mandatory documents cover topic such as:
            How to calculate audit duration for certification audits
            How to develop a multisite audit program and sampling process
            The evaluation of auditor competencies
        Other documents includes 
            Guidance Documents
            Informative Documents

    ISO19011
        A standard that doesn't need to be used by lead auditors undertaking certification audits
        Does not replace the use of ISO17021-1
        A guidance for lead auditors hence it is optional
        Not possible to acieve certification against ISO19011
        Organizations often choose to use this as a guidance for their internal audit processes and auditing of management systems
        
    Principles of Auditing
        ISO17021-1 and ISO19011 contains information on auditing
        ISO17021-1  principles apply mainly the the way  the certification body operates
        ISO19011 principles apply more to the behavior of the auditors 
            First principle: Integrity, honesty, transparency
            Second principle: Fair presentation
            Third principle: Professional care
            Fourth principle: Confidentiality
            Fifth principle: Conflict of Interest

07. Understanding Audit roles and responsibilities

    Audit Team Leader / Lead Auditor
        A representative from the certification body who has key responsibility for managing the audit
        Role auditor's role will start with the initial contact with the audit client
        Liaise and agree with the client on audit delivery process and confirm the content of the audit
        Responsibilities include:
            Agreeing to the feasibility of the audit with the audit client, taking different factors into account and ensuring audit risks are managed
            Undertaking audit preparation (Documents, resources, coordinating logistics for the audit team)
            Audit plan preparation, considering all necessary factors
            Deciding roles of the audit team (who, what, where, when the auditors will be working)
            Conduct the opening meeting with the auditee and management
            Managing audit delivery
            Managing the audit team
            Maintain relationship with audit clients
            Evaluating audit findings to reach audit conclusions
            Conduct closing meeting
            Prepare and distribute audit reports after the audit
            Approve and verify corrective actions stemming from the audit
        In the case of one man team, the sole auditor will be the lead auditor
        In case of team settings, the lead auditor will also undertake auditor role on top of the lead auditor role

    Auditor
        Works below the lead auditor undertaking audit duties appropriate the his/her competencies and knowledge of the business processes
        Auditor activities are captured in the audit plan 
        Duties include:
            Documentation reviews
            Data analysis and evaluation
            Carry out site visits
            Conducting interviews of the auditees
            Verify information received from the auditee
            Involvement with remote auditing techniques
            Identify and documenting audit findings
            Maintain appropriate audit records
            Attend opening and closing meetings
            Contributing to the writing of the audit report
        Differences:    
            An auditor does not manage the audit process but may contribute towards discussion about the audit conclusions
            Lead auditor will take overall responsibiility for the audit conclusions
            Auditor identify potential audit findings but lead auditor takes responsibility for deciding on the applicability/validity of the findings

    Technical Specialist
        Technical specialist are people who is part of the audit team to contribute specific knowledge or understanding that the auditors might not have
        They work together with the auditors or sometimes work on specific areas of an audit
        Example of Technical Specialists:
            Regulatory/Legislative Specialists
            Specialists in a particular part of the organization's activities or processes
        If the company applies for ISO14001 operates a complex wastewater treatment system, a specialist for that area may be asked to join the team
        In some cases the technical specialist provides language skills or translation services to the audit team or guidance and advice on cultural issues
        They provide local contact the the auditors might not understand
        The technical specialist, although not a fully competent auditor, can identify the audit findings and raise them with the lead auditor
        They are available to help the auditor understand technical aspects of the operation that the lead auditor would not be expected to understand (ie process knowledge or product knowledge, etc)
        The lead auditor may need to consider what audit techniques are appropriate for the technical specialist to use
        And how best to include the technical specialist into the audit process

    Certification Reviewer
        Once the audit is complete, the lead auditor writes and submit s the report and other documentation back to the certification body
        The report will include a recommendation for certification
        It is the role of certification reviewer to review the documents submitted by the lead auditor and to consider the recommendation
        The role is to act as verifier of the audit conclusions, to ensure the correct processes have been followed (ie. correct number of audit days being carried out, etc )
        It also ensures there is an independent decision made about the certification from someone who has no contact with the client
        The certification reviewer is appointed by the certification body and must have the same level of competency as the lead auditor
            Competency with audit processes
            The standard being audited against
            The industry of the company being audited

    Audit Client    
        The audit client is an organization who requires the audit to be conducted and is essential for all certification audits
        In practice, the audit client is usually a person within the organization
        The term "audit client" and "auditee" is interchangeable 
            The "audit client" is used to describe the person (usually a senior manager/executive/director) within the company who requests and manages the audit
            The term "auditee" is used to describe anyone being audited
        The audit client will request the audit to take place and will activate the person who contract the certification body to undertake the audit
        They are reponsible for agreeing to the audit scope and criteria with the certification body
        After the audit, the audit client is usually the person responsible for communicating any corrections or corrective actions with the lead auditor or certification body
        The audit client is the person who has been delegated the responsibility for the implementation of the management system or for providing assurance to the company
        They may also be the technical lead within the business for the management system
        In large corporations, the audit client responsibilities might sit at different levels of the organization
            Example: A corporate director might delegate responsibilities to functional manager or to local site manager (in the case of multisite audits)
        The audit client acts as the coordinator between the lead auditor and the company being audited
        Audit Clients are responsible for:
            Ensuring the Lead Auditor has all the information needed to plan and prepare the audit
            Ensuring informations that affect risks to the audit is identified and highlighted to the auditor (ie shutdown periods, special circumstances that affect manager's availability, HSE risks)
            Arranging opening meetings and interviews with management and others within the company
            Planning site visits and ensuring local managers are coordinated to take part
            Preparing and providing resources for the audit team, (i.e. suitable workspaces)
            Providing documentation that is requested by the audit team
            Answering any questions posed by the management team regarding the audit process or audit findings (ie dates, times, audits, scope, etc)
            Arranging hosts/guides for the audit team
            Preparing corrections and corrective actions
            Managing and reporting on closure of audit findings
            
    Management Team
        The management team of the company being audited is critical to the success of the audit
        Audits of management systems cannot take place without the involvement of the management
        The management team are the people within the company that direct and controls the activities being audited 
        It includes the senior person i.e the managing director, the CEO, Directors (excluding non-executives), Heads of departments and managers
        For larger companies, it will be limited to those who have more direct responsibilities
        The management team are responsible for the following:
            Attending opening and closing meetings, and daily debrief meetings if required
            Being interviewed and providing honest, open and truthful information to the auditor
            Communicating the audit to their staff, and requiring their involvement in audit activities
            Providing resources the audit team needs (i.e ensuring the managers are available and time for interviews, available hosts, meeting rooms)
            Providing audit evidence requested by the audit team (ie. providing documents, records, allowing site visits)
            Preparing and undertaking correction and corrective actions in response to audit findings
        Some of the responsibilities overlaps with the responsibilities of audit client    
        The audit client carries out the responsibilities but the management team have the authority for approving the audit client

    Auditee
        Refers to the entire company being audited
        OR refers to anyone involved in the audit process
        List of auditees may include:
            Audit client
            Senior managemement
            Supervisors
            Operators
            Contractors
        The auditees need to understand that the audit is taking place
        And they need to make time available to participate in the audit process
        This could include changing schedule, appointments, or arranging for deputies to be available
        Auditees will be asked to explain processes to auditors or to show them around the organization or site
        They could be asked to provide copies of records or other documents
        Ideallly auditees would answer questions openly and honestly helping the auditors to understand the reality of the QMS effectiveness
        However, sometimes auditees are concerned about exposing audit findings for fear that nonconformities could be raised and this would look bad on them
        Auditors and lead auditors are to ensure the auditees are comfortable

    Hosts/Guides
        Hosts or guides maybe required to escort the audit team through the business
        They'll carry out duties such as guiding the audit team and auditors to the right place
        They'll also introduce them to the right people and ensure safety on site
        They may also gather audit evidence as requested by the audit team
        A good practice is if the hosts/guides are asked not to answer questions posed to management or staff during the audits
        They are often tempted to do so because they understand the management system more than the person being asked
        However, the auditor may not actually need to know the answer but is more interested in whether the person being asked the question knows the answer

    Audit Criteria and Objectives
        The objectives and criteria will be defined by the audit client and certification body
        Auditors should be competent in the standards he/she is going to audit against as reference
        If the auditor didn't know the audit team well, check if the audit team members are also competent on the standards they are going to refer to
        For combined audits, not everyone in the team needs to be competent in the every single standard
        Example: One auditor competent in ISO9001 and the another auditor competent in ISO14001
        Lead auditors only need competency in one of the standards
        The audit objectives are written by the certification body
        
        Objectives:
            How well the company meets the requirements of the QMS/EMS standards
            How well the company is implementing its own managements systems (Are they developing their own procedures and are they following them)
            How well the managment system can ensure compliance with compliance obligations the company has
                Example: Through ISO27001 (Information Security) processes, it will have identified compliance obligations such as legal requirements, 
                but is it in compliance with the legal requirements
            How effective is the management system in meeting its specified objectives?
                Example: The organization will have set objectives as part of ISO9001 systems, but are they being achieved?
            Find out whether there are areas for potential improvement of the management systems
                Example: Are there opportunities to improve training so that staff are more competent?
                
        Audit objectives are to confirm the implementation of management program that conform with the stated criteria and deliveries
            - Control of risks
            - Understanding level of complilance with identified compliance obligations
            - Ongoing improvements in performance

        The certification body will define the set of audit objectives that you can simply use without making any changes
        It is useful to know what the purpose of the audit objectives are
        Consider the audit objectives as the "Why" the audit is taking place

    Audit scope 
        Describes the what and where of the audit (i.e Which site, what processes)
        Example:
            Only the facility will be audited
            In this case, the scope will specify only the facilities management activities
        Exclusions to scope should also be captured
            Example: If the company has an off-site warehouse but it's not part of the audit
            Then this should be noted as an exclusion
        Example:
            Scope Statement
                Scope of audit scope:
                    Manufacturing of parts
                    Components
                    Assemblies
                Associated With:
                    "Company Address"
        Scope is usually defined by the audit client and the certification body
        It is critical for lead auditor to understand the scope as it will be used to define the audit plan
        It's no use finishing the audit just to find out you're on the wrong site or wrong part of the business
