    Auditor Assumptions
        Auditor may expect to see the Quality manual, although a useful document but it's not a mandatory document for auditors to check
        Determine what the real requirements are - Usually done during the document review phase
        Just because something is different, doesnt mean it does not comply with the requirements
        NOTE: Know the difference between the Quality Policy and Quality Manual. Quality Policies are mandatory to exist
        
    3 methods for finding evidence
        Review the documents and records
            Asking for them from the auditee and reading them thoroughly
            It's the auditee's responsibility to find the procedures (Note that non-mandatory documents wont be available)
            Verify nonconformance by checking the process or activity
        Interviewing the employees
            If there is no record or procedure, then interview the employees for the method
            Interview a few employees because one employee will not give a solid proof
            If they give different answers, it proves that the process is not defined or untrained
        Observation of facilities and activities
            In some cases, you will have to observe the activities and facilities together with reading the documents and records and interviewing the employees
            This method can sometime be the only way to check whether or not the company is  complying with its own procedures and standards
            Visiting the production facility to check how a particular process is carried out
            Determine the process is compliant with the procedure and whther it fits the statements of the employees

        NOTE: Audit team shouldn't go beyond the scope of the audit during the onsite audit

    Sampling the Records
        Sometimes it's not possible to read all the records especially for large corporations
        Find the most relevant records or records for the most complex process
        Also focus on training records of employees who are involved in this process - primarily new employees
        New employees tend to have higher chance of not being properly trained
        Don't let the auditee provide you with the records of their choice

    Interviewing Techniques
        Interviewing people is the most difficult way of finding evidence but the best way to find out how the company operates
        Use open ended questions (ie. questions starting with the phrase "Please describe")
        Close ended question should be avoided (Short answers - ie. Y/N answers)
        Find out the root cause of the problem by asking the 5 whys

    Audit findings
        2 outcomes - Nonconformities/Observations
        Nonconformities: Raised when auditor finds the proof that something is wrong
        Observations: Raised when auditor cant thinks something is wrong and has no evidence to back it up
        Outcomes must be documented in the internal audit report
        
    Nonconformities
        When a certain requirement is not complied
        Requirements:
            ISO9001 standard itself
            Quality Policies and procedures - complying with internal rules
            Requirements of interested parties - Client requirements for quality
            NOTE: If there is no requirement, nonconformity cannot be raised

    Observations
        Raised when there is no solid proof when there is nonconformity
        Observations can be both negative or positive

    Internal Audit vs External Audit
        External Audits are done by the certification body or external companies
        Internal audits are done by the employees or contractors employed by the company

    Annual Audit Program
        Assuring information security and confidentiality
        The period audits will be planned (1 to 3 years)
        The period audits will be conducted
            Once for the entire small company or number of times depending on number of departments for lager companies
        Scope of each audit - Define precisely what each audit will cover, A single complex process can be subdivided into multiple audits
        Checking compliance with legal requirements can also be defined
        Audit criteria
            ISO9001 standards
            Documentations
            3rd party requirements for QMS
        Define which method will be used for auditing
            Doc review, interviews, observation of activities
        Who will be performing the audit - One person or a team, 
            Put emphasis on parts of the company that are more important in terms of quality or higher risks
        Take into account previous audit results
            Going for the department that has lower audit score and conducting more detailed checks

    Audit Plan for an Individual audit
        ISO9001 does not specify what should be included in the audit plan
        Audit plan is not mandatory
        List of all the departments or elements of the QMS you plan to audit in this individual audit
            -Organize the audit department by department or clause by clause
        Timing for each of these items (i.e HR at 9am, Production at 11am, etc)
        Contact persons for each of the item in the list
        If more than 1 auditor, specify who will audit what. Lead auditors should be included in internal audit procedure, not audit plan
        Objectives, criteria and methods from the Audit program can be copied
        Audit plan doesn't need to contain questions to be asked during the audit (Questions should be in internal audit checklist instead)

    Creation of checklist
        Purpose is to remind what needed to be done during the audit
        But the problem during the audit is that auditors need to speak to alot of people for various evidences, clauses, policies and procedures
        All that is impossible without the reminder or list
        Checklist will be created during the document review - Take note of what needed to be check during the review
        Might drive the auditor in one direction and miss some newly discovered leads that havent been planned in the checklist
        Example, while process being performed correctly, you might miss that top management didn't provide enough resources to resolve nonconformities
        Best approach is to have one document with 4 columns
            > Clause
            > Description of requirements
            > Compliance: Y/N
            > Notes

    Internal Audit Report
        A mandatory document according to ISO9001
        Results are to be stored for few years
        3 parts of the report
            > General: Dates, name, which part of the company being audited, audit criteria, other general information
            > Nonconformities found
            > Observations
        Doesnt have to be a detailed report but it needs to be precise
        Report should be issued and distributed as defined in the audit plan/procedure

    Corrective Action follow up
        It is not enough to write corrective actio request. 
        As internal auditor, follow up and make sure it is completed
        Also check  the corrective action form as this will provide an insight of what has been done
        Make sure that the root cause of nonconformity was resolved
        The follow up will be some kind of small audit focused on this nonconformity
        Conduct follow up check within 1 month

    Recording of Evidence
        Internal audit records need to be produced as it is a mandatory document
        It is crucial for internal auditor to write everything being heard or discovered
        Include date, version number, record names, serial number
        For interviews, write the name of the interviewee, job title, date and time and exact quotes that are relevant
        For observation of the facilities and processes, write the exact rooms, location, date and time, description of what being discovered
        Write all the evidence in the internal audit checklist

    What is certification
        Certification is a voluntary decision that can be made by any organization that they are complying with the management system standards
        Certification are offered by certification bodies which in turn accredited by the accreditation body
        Certification are offered to any organization of any size
        Auditors are the people who will conduct the audit on behalf of the certification body
        Auditors must have experience of the type of organization that they are auditing
        Auditors must have the competency in the standard being audited, auditing process and training or experience in auditing management systems
        Certification bodies need to develop their processes to ensure their auditors are competent
        Auditors' competency is a big part of what accreditation bodies will check

    Certification Process
        Certification process starts with an "implementation project" to ensure they meet the requirements of the standard
        This also develops the processes and documentation needed
        The company will then choose which certification body will conduct the certification audits
        Certification bodies are actually commercial businesses offering different rates and services
        The certification body will collect information about their clients and decide how many audits are necessary and decide the audit program
        They will also conduct "Gap analysis audit" which is an additional audit and not part of the certification process
        2 stages of Initial certification process:            
            Find out which part of the standard and process needs to be improved
                Check if there are any basic framework and process in place
            Test the implementation of the organizations' management system
                Check if the last audit being fixed
                Assess if the organization has met all the requirements and standards
            NOTE: 
                If the nonconformities are not major nonconformances, they can still be awarded the certificate
                Organizations do also need to show the certification body that they will make the required improvements
        The certificate is valid for 3 years but the organization will continue to be audited at regular intervals during the period
            1st Contact > Gap Analysis > Stage 1 > Stage 2 > Recommendation for Cert > Surveillance > Recertification
            Stage 1 -> Stage 2 -> Surveillance Audits -> Recertification Audit

    Certification of integrated management systems
        An organization may have combination of ISO standards. I.e 9001, 14001, 50001
        In the case of organizations with combined standards, certification body may conduct a integrated management system audit
        The auditors will assess that the management system requirements for each standard are being achieved
        Since there are overlaps between the management systems, the total number of audit days are lesser compared to separate audits
        The organization only has to organize 1 audit program to caover the integrated management system

    Accreditation and ISO17021
        ISO17021:2015 is a standard certification bodies need to meet to achieve accreditation
        Accreditation are independent or government regulated bodies
        The accredited status gives the certification bodies the right to issue formal certificates
        ISO17021-1 covers the requirements for all certification body audits 
        Accreditation process involves 
            An audit of the certification body's management system
            Witnessed audits to assess the competency of lead auditors
            Application of the certification body's processes
        Accreditation body will not be there to audit the audit client, but to audit the certification body's work
        ISO17021-1 covers:
            Clause 4 - Audit Principles
            Clause 9 - Audit Processes
            Annexes - Auditor Competencies and Evaluation methods
            Ramaining clauses - 
                Auditors, 
                Auditing Processes, 
                Management Systems 
                    Certification issuance, 
                    Confidentiality management, 
                    Conflict of interest, 
                    Appeals and complains management
        ISO17021-1 Topics:
            Audit Principles
            Audit Program
            Audit Delivery
            Auditor competency and evaluation
            
    Competencies of Lead Auditors required by ISO17021-1
        Requires certification bodies to establish competency criteria, evaluation methods and competency development processes
        Requires auditors to acquire general knowledge and skills (Found in Annex A)
            Knowledge of audit principles, practices, and techniques that apply to all management system audits
            Knowledge of the processes and procedures of the certification body
            Knowledge of the specific sector's business operations, products, processes and organization
            Knowledge of general business management practices, for different types of businesses
            Presentation skills, note taking and report writing
            Interviewing skills
            Audit management skills
            Sufficient language skills
         NOTE: There are also further defined skills in other standards in ISO17021 series 
            ISO17021-2 for ISO14001
            ISO17021-3 for ISO9001

    International Accreditation Forum (IAF) Documents
        Is an association for the various accreditation bodies around the world/
        Its aim is to bring about coordination and assimilation between different accreditation bodies involved in conformity assessments
        Accreditation bodies that signed the IAF Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) agreed to recognize other accreditations
        IAF pulblishes various documents including mandatory documents used by accreditation bodies when auditing certification bodies
        Useful for certification bodies and lead auditors as they give more details on how to implement the requirements of ISO17021-1
        The mandatory documents cover topic such as:
            How to calculate audit duration for certification audits
            How to develop a multisite audit program and sampling process
            The evaluation of auditor competencies
        Other documents includes 
            Guidance Documents
            Informative Documents

    ISO19011
        A standard that doesn't need to be used by lead auditors undertaking certification audits
        Does not replace the use of ISO17021-1
        A guidance for lead auditors hence it is optional
        Not possible to acieve certification against ISO19011
        Organizations often choose to use this as a guidance for their internal audit processes and auditing of management systems
        
    Principles of Auditing
        ISO17021-1 and ISO19011 contains information on auditing
        ISO17021-1  principles apply mainly the the way  the certification body operates
        ISO19011 principles apply more to the behavior of the auditors 
            First principle: Integrity, honesty, transparency
            Second principle: Fair presentation
            Third principle: Professional care
            Fourth principle: Confidentiality
            Fifth principle: Conflict of Interest

07. Understanding Audit roles and responsibilities

    Audit Team Leader / Lead Auditor
        A representative from the certification body who has key responsibility for managing the audit
        Role auditor's role will start with the initial contact with the audit client
        Liaise and agree with the client on audit delivery process and confirm the content of the audit
        Responsibilities include:
            Agreeing to the feasibility of the audit with the audit client, taking different factors into account and ensuring audit risks are managed
            Undertaking audit preparation (Documents, resources, coordinating logistics for the audit team)
            Audit plan preparation, considering all necessary factors
            Deciding roles of the audit team (who, what, where, when the auditors will be working)
            Conduct the opening meeting with the auditee and management
            Managing audit delivery
            Managing the audit team
            Maintain relationship with audit clients
            Evaluating audit findings to reach audit conclusions
            Conduct closing meeting
            Prepare and distribute audit reports after the audit
            Approve and verify corrective actions stemming from the audit
        In the case of one man team, the sole auditor will be the lead auditor
        In case of team settings, the lead auditor will also undertake auditor role on top of the lead auditor role

    Auditor
        Works below the lead auditor undertaking audit duties appropriate the his/her competencies and knowledge of the business processes
        Auditor activities are captured in the audit plan 
        Duties include:
            Documentation reviews
            Data analysis and evaluation
            Carry out site visits
            Conducting interviews of the auditees
            Verify information received from the auditee
            Involvement with remote auditing techniques
            Identify and documenting audit findings
            Maintain appropriate audit records
            Attend opening and closing meetings
            Contributing to the writing of the audit report
        Differences:    
            An auditor does not manage the audit process but may contribute towards discussion about the audit conclusions
            Lead auditor will take overall responsibiility for the audit conclusions
            Auditor identify potential audit findings but lead auditor takes responsibility for deciding on the applicability/validity of the findings

    Technical Specialist
        Technical specialist are people who is part of the audit team to contribute specific knowledge or understanding that the auditors might not have
        They work together with the auditors or sometimes work on specific areas of an audit
        Example of Technical Specialists:
            Regulatory/Legislative Specialists
            Specialists in a particular part of the organization's activities or processes
        If the company applies for ISO14001 operates a complex wastewater treatment system, a specialist for that area may be asked to join the team
        In some cases the technical specialist provides language skills or translation services to the audit team or guidance and advice on cultural issues
        They provide local contact the the auditors might not understand
        The technical specialist, although not a fully competent auditor, can identify the audit findings and raise them with the lead auditor
        They are available to help the auditor understand technical aspects of the operation that the lead auditor would not be expected to understand (ie process knowledge or product knowledge, etc)
        The lead auditor may need to consider what audit techniques are appropriate for the technical specialist to use
        And how best to include the technical specialist into the audit process

    Certification Reviewer
        Once the audit is complete, the lead auditor writes and submit s the report and other documentation back to the certification body
        The report will include a recommendation for certification
        It is the role of certification reviewer to review the documents submitted by the lead auditor and to consider the recommendation
        The role is to act as verifier of the audit conclusions, to ensure the correct processes have been followed (ie. correct number of audit days being carried out, etc )
        It also ensures there is an independent decision made about the certification from someone who has no contact with the client
        The certification reviewer is appointed by the certification body and must have the same level of competency as the lead auditor
            Competency with audit processes
            The standard being audited against
            The industry of the company being audited

    Audit Client    
        The audit client is an organization who requires the audit to be conducted and is essential for all certification audits
        In practice, the audit client is usually a person within the organization
        The term "audit client" and "auditee" is interchangeable 
            The "audit client" is used to describe the person (usually a senior manager/executive/director) within the company who requests and manages the audit
            The term "auditee" is used to describe anyone being audited
        The audit client will request the audit to take place and will activate the person who contract the certification body to undertake the audit
        They are reponsible for agreeing to the audit scope and criteria with the certification body
        After the audit, the audit client is usually the person responsible for communicating any corrections or corrective actions with the lead auditor or certification body
        The audit client is the person who has been delegated the responsibility for the implementation of the management system or for providing assurance to the company
        They may also be the technical lead within the business for the management system
        In large corporations, the audit client responsibilities might sit at different levels of the organization
            Example: A corporate director might delegate responsibilities to functional manager or to local site manager (in the case of multisite audits)
        The audit client acts as the coordinator between the lead auditor and the company being audited
        Audit Clients are responsible for:
            Ensuring the Lead Auditor has all the information needed to plan and prepare the audit
            Ensuring informations that affect risks to the audit is identified and highlighted to the auditor (ie shutdown periods, special circumstances that affect manager's availability, HSE risks)
            Arranging opening meetings and interviews with management and others within the company
            Planning site visits and ensuring local managers are coordinated to take part
            Preparing and providing resources for the audit team, (i.e. suitable workspaces)
            Providing documentation that is requested by the audit team
            Answering any questions posed by the management team regarding the audit process or audit findings (ie dates, times, audits, scope, etc)
            Arranging hosts/guides for the audit team
            Preparing corrections and corrective actions
            Managing and reporting on closure of audit findings
            
    Management Team
        The management team of the company being audited is critical to the success of the audit
        Audits of management systems cannot take place without the involvement of the management
        The management team are the people within the company that direct and controls the activities being audited 
        It includes the senior person i.e the managing director, the CEO, Directors (excluding non-executives), Heads of departments and managers
        For larger companies, it will be limited to those who have more direct responsibilities
        The management team are responsible for the following:
            Attending opening and closing meetings, and daily debrief meetings if required
            Being interviewed and providing honest, open and truthful information to the auditor
            Communicating the audit to their staff, and requiring their involvement in audit activities
            Providing resources the audit team needs (i.e ensuring the managers are available and time for interviews, available hosts, meeting rooms)
            Providing audit evidence requested by the audit team (ie. providing documents, records, allowing site visits)
            Preparing and undertaking correction and corrective actions in response to audit findings
        Some of the responsibilities overlaps with the responsibilities of audit client    
        The audit client carries out the responsibilities but the management team have the authority for approving the audit client

    Auditee
        Refers to the entire company being audited
        OR refers to anyone involved in the audit process
        List of auditees may include:
            Audit client
            Senior managemement
            Supervisors
            Operators
            Contractors
        The auditees need to understand that the audit is taking place
        And they need to make time available to participate in the audit process
        This could include changing schedule, appointments, or arranging for deputies to be available
        Auditees will be asked to explain processes to auditors or to show them around the organization or site
        They could be asked to provide copies of records or other documents
        Ideallly auditees would answer questions openly and honestly helping the auditors to understand the reality of the QMS effectiveness
        However, sometimes auditees are concerned about exposing audit findings for fear that nonconformities could be raised and this would look bad on them
        Auditors and lead auditors are to ensure the auditees are comfortable

    Hosts/Guides
        Hosts or guides maybe required to escort the audit team through the business
        They'll carry out duties such as guiding the audit team and auditors to the right place
        They'll also introduce them to the right people and ensure safety on site
        They may also gather audit evidence as requested by the audit team
        A good practice is if the hosts/guides are asked not to answer questions posed to management or staff during the audits
        They are often tempted to do so because they understand the management system more than the person being asked
        However, the auditor may not actually need to know the answer but is more interested in whether the person being asked the question knows the answer

    Audit Criteria and Objectives
        The objectives and criteria will be defined by the audit client and certification body
        Auditors should be competent in the standards he/she is going to audit against as reference
        If the auditor didn't know the audit team well, check if the audit team members are also competent on the standards they are going to refer to
        For combined audits, not everyone in the team needs to be competent in the every single standard
        Example: One auditor competent in ISO9001 and the another auditor competent in ISO14001
        Lead auditors only need competency in one of the standards
        The audit objectives are written by the certification body
        
        Objectives:
            How well the company meets the requirements of the QMS/EMS standards
            How well the company is implementing its own managements systems (Are they developing their own procedures and are they following them)
            How well the managment system can ensure compliance with compliance obligations the company has
                Example: Through ISO27001 (Information Security) processes, it will have identified compliance obligations such as legal requirements, 
                but is it in compliance with the legal requirements
            How effective is the management system in meeting its specified objectives?
                Example: The organization will have set objectives as part of ISO9001 systems, but are they being achieved?
            Find out whether there are areas for potential improvement of the management systems
                Example: Are there opportunities to improve training so that staff are more competent?
                
        Audit objectives are to confirm the implementation of management program that conform with the stated criteria and deliveries
            - Control of risks
            - Understanding level of complilance with identified compliance obligations
            - Ongoing improvements in performance

        The certification body will define the set of audit objectives that you can simply use without making any changes
        It is useful to know what the purpose of the audit objectives are
        Consider the audit objectives as the "Why" the audit is taking place

    Audit scope 
        Describes the what and where of the audit (i.e Which site, what processes)
        Example:
            Only the facility will be audited
            In this case, the scope will specify only the facilities management activities
        Exclusions to scope should also be captured
            Example: If the company has an off-site warehouse but it's not part of the audit
            Then this should be noted as an exclusion
        Example:
            Scope Statement
                Scope of audit scope:
                    Manufacturing of parts
                    Components
                    Assemblies
                Associated With:
                    "Company Address"
        Scope is usually defined by the audit client and the certification body
        It is critical for lead auditor to understand the scope as it will be used to define the audit plan
        It's no use finishing the audit just to find out you're on the wrong site or wrong part of the business

    Selecting Audit Methods
        The various techniques that are used for conducting the audit
        4 classification 
            Human interaction
            No human interaction
            On site
            Off site

        Onsite human interaction
            Conducting interviews
            Working through questionnaires or checklists
            Involvement with the auditee
            Visitation to the site
            Reviewing documents with the auditee
        
        Offsite human interaction
            Interviews over the phone, video conferencing, etc
            
        Onsite no human interaction
            Carrying out work without the auditee involvement
            Reviewing documents
            Evaluating data
            Observing activities
            Carry out sampling for analytical work
            
        Offsite no human interaction
            Reviewing data offsite
            
        When planning audit, consider which of the methods will be used based on objectives, scope and audit criteria
        Decide what methods will best fit to gather the audit evidence needed to meet the audit objectives
        Reading written procedures wont show how the management system is the performing
        The best audit plans often include several audit methods appropriate to the audit
        
    Sampling evidence in audits
        Sampling evidences is a justifiable process (ie Checking if 5 training courses is provided to the 1000 employees)
        As lead auditor, set standards for sampling with the auditors to ensure consistency and to ensure any standards set be certification body have been met
        Best to agree on any sampling rate with the auditors in advance
        The sampling rate should be included in the audit plan
        Allow a degree of flexibility so the auditors can follow certain audit trails if they believe they have any concerns
        ONLY define minimum sampling rates and allow auditors to use their judgement to decide a maximum 
        
    Types of remote auditing techniques
        Some audits especially financial or IT audits use Computer Assisted Audit Techniques (CAATS)
        Utilizes software or programmes to evaluate data and information automatically
        Although CAATS are not used widely in management system audits, other types of techniques are increasingly used
        Example:
            Simple emails (For communications)
            CCTV (Allows auditors to conduct surveillance of the organization)
        No human interaction (i.e Document review, data analysis, evaluation) fits remote auditing
        Because of concerns with privacy and personal rights, using CCTV is less common

    Deciding when to use remote auditing techniques
        When and How to audit remotely depends on the audit objectives, scope, criteria, available technology, tech competency, type of audit evidence to be gathered
        The certification body will have processes that will tell when remote auditing can or cannot be used
        There are advantages and disadvantages for remote auditing techniques
        There may be pressure to audit remotely as a cost saving measure and to reduce the impact on the organization from audits
        It is often best to use remote auditing alongside other auditng methods
        

    Planning the Audit
        Make sure that other team members are clear in their role in using the remote auditing techniques
        Develop a plan that identifies what technique is to be used and what information should be gathered
        The audit plan should also include which software and what equipment will be used
        Communicate between auditee and auditors ensuring that they have the competencies on the software or equipment being used
        Consider how this will affect the audit team and the ability to manage the team (ie separate auditor location could impact communication)
        Ensure that the technique is documented in the audit report

    Selecting the audit team
        The selection is usually done by the certification body and not the lead auditor
        The lead auditor is sometimes given this responsibility or involved in the process
        As lead auditor, understand how the team should be selected
        Selection can be done when the objectives, scope, criteria and methods have been agreed to
        Determine:
            How many auditors need to be on the team
            What competencies auditors need to have (ie Auditees' business operations, audit criteria to be referenced against, and competencies in conducting audits)
            Determine if technical specialists are needed
            Personal behaviour (Necessary qualities to conduct the audit according to Topic 6 - Understanding Auditing standards)
        Lead auditors are able to reschedule the audit when properly competent auditors are available even it means some business disruption

    Managing audit risks
        Everybody is responsible for everyone's safety
        Risks should be identified and mitigation plan agreed to by the auditee
        Do a formal risk identification and control plan for a larger/more complex/highi risk audits
        Types of risk:            
            Risk to the business
                Product confomity risk due to audit
                Personnel safety
                Data and Information Security Risk
            Auditor's risk
                Travel risk (Travelling to the site)
                Weather conditions
                Personal security
                Safety response activities
                Welfare issues (Food, Toilets, Workplace suitability)
            Audit objectives
                Auditor competency
                Auditee responsiveness
                Communications
                etc
            
    Preparing the audit plan
        Contains the followings:
            Schedule table columns: Time, Activity, Purpose, Location, Host, Auditee
            Schedule for where to go and who to meet
            Relevant information being recorded and captured
            Documents how the information meets the objective
            Audit scope and criteria
            Identified audit methods
            Information on remote auditing
            Planned sampling arrangements planned in audit methods
            Site information: Distances, Language, Organization operation hours, Lunch breaks, Time (UTC, Standard Timing, etc)
        Allow time to prepare for audit activities (Closing meeting) and audit findings evaluation   
        A point at which auditing evidence gathering ceases
            
    Allocating audit activities to auditors        
        Match allocate the activities based on the competency of the individual auditor
        Consider whether to have auditors working individually or in pairs or groups
        This gives the opportunity to combine strength and weaknesses of different auditors
        Pair up auditors with less experience with those who are experienced
        In the audit plan, specify the activities that you want each auditor to be doing
        If possible, make sure that they are happy with this allocation and are comfortable with their roles you've given them
        Do the allocation during the pre-audit communications and discussions
        Be conscious that things sometimes change during the audit and may need to re-allocate tasks

    Making contact with the audit client
        Lead auditor is the person who makes contact with the audit client to plan and agree on the audit activities
        During the contact, inform the audit client of the objectives, scope, criteria, audit methods, and audit team members
        Discuss what the audit plan is (ie, scheduling of meetings, interviews, site visits, staff availability, host/guides, transportation)
        Obtain information, documents and evidencefrom the auditee before any on-site activities
        Provide the audit client with a list of evidence that they should prepare prior to the start of the audit
        Check risk issues like whether there are any factors that could prevent the audit plan being followed
        Find out if there are any legal issues, contractual issues, confidentiality issues, security concerns for the company
        Arrangements for health, safety, and welfare for the audit team
        Check for issues regarding access controls, photography permits, or other security and data privacy measures, internet connectivity
        Ensure that the plan is achievable and ensure the audit client is aware of what to expect during the audit and has all the information they need for the audit
        
    Preparation of audit resources
        Tools needed to undertake the audit
            Equipment
            Documentation
            Software        
        Documentation usually have already been developed as part of the certification body's procedures
        Review the documents and consider whether additional documentation is necessary
        Additional documentation includes:
            Checklists
            Sampling plans
            Forms to record information or audit evidence
        Resources includes:
            Laptops
            Projectors
            PPE
            Sampling equipment
                Take note of the calibration date for sampling equipment
        Resources includes:
            Software
            Presentation materials/templates for opening and closing meetings
        Other resources includes:
            Logistical arrangements (Travel and accommodation arrangements)

    Opening Meeting
        Each audit starts with an opening meeting
        The format depends on the type of audit, the organization and the scope of audit
        It is appropriate to invite the management team, other relevant senior managers, audit client, hosts and guides
        All the members of the audit team will also attend
        For audits whose scope is limited to one part of the company, it is sufficient to invite the management from the relevant area
        However the audit client may want to invite management from other parts of the business at audit client's discretion
        For smaller/shorter audits (ie 1-2 days audit) the invitees may include just managers or those who are relevant to the scope of the audit
        The meeting should provide opportunity for audit client and audit team to discuss the audit process and confirm that the agreed audit plan is still applicable
        The meeting agendas:
            Objectives
            Scope
            Criteria
            Plan
            Instructions for the audit team
            Methods
            Conclusion expectation for auditees
        The meeting typically takes about 30 minutes and should be adequate to set the scene for the audit
        Ensure that the auditees and management are fully aware of the audit process
        The company may provide a short introduction to the business
        This may highlight any security, safety issues, or risk control measures
        The meeting should also provide opportunity for the auditees to ask questions or raise concerns

    Managing site visits
        There are different challenges in auditing as a team than auditing alone as the lead auditor
        It is not unusual for the audit team to follow different sets of questions and ended up splitting without pupose
        Ensure that site visits have one of the following
            Orientation
                Allow the audit team to get an understanding of the layout of the organization 
                Limit questions during the visits but take note of areas you want to return to
                Orientation visit is useful during the start of the audit to allow team members to be familiarized with the site layout
                The disadvantage is that the team will be delayed if the team ask alot of questions unknowingly starting the audit
                Be clear with the team what the pupose of the visit is and ask the audit client to make such visits brief
            Evidence Gathering
                Such visits allow auditors to follow a process or review activities in more detail to understand the processes and behaviors of the company 
                Allow time to questions, follow audit trails, and to verify answers
                Auditors may carry out the visits individually or in small groups
                Make plan to conduct such audit as a team or split the team into smaller groups to visit areas of their interest according to their roles
            Deployment and verification visits 
                Usually a shorter visits to verify tasks or activities are carried out according to plan
                Allow time for questions and following audit evidence
                Include areas of the site that are not often visited
                If audit scope covers the entire building, and activities are carried out in all of them, make sure to visit those unknown areas
                Start site visits on the external areas of the site and then work your way towards the center of operations
        Allow the auditee to take lead and demonstrate how well they are conforming to the management system
        Prevent the auditee from taking over the process and prevent the audit from being diverted away from the areas of concern
        Be persistent without being argumentative when discussing with the auditee

    Interviews
        Ensure the interviews are arranged in advanced if possible
        Be flexible with the audit plan and make changes
        Coordinate the purpose and objectives of all the team's interviews so the auditors are following the meaningful lines of enquiry
        Different auditors may want to pursue different interviews as they progress through the audit
        Ensure to prevent auditors from going over the same interviewee potentially asking the same questions
        Ensure that the auditors prepared the interview plan capturing who they are auditing, what the objectives are, and what questions they want answers to
        Ensure the auditors to record down their interviews, notes and any nonconformances (the cause of the problem and the consequence)
        Produce a pro-forma sheet for auditors to complete during interviews (only for less experienced auditors)
        Pro forma sheet may include:
            Interviewee name
            Job title
            Role
            Specific questions to be asked
            Interviewee responses notes
            Evidences and findings
            Potential non conformity
            
    Audit evidence requests        
        Evidences: Procedures, records, reports, certificates, photos, emails, etc
        The evidences list can become extensive and the auditee will be busy collecting the evidences
        As lead auditor, manage the requests, coordinate them from the team and check the evidence ahas been provided
        Maintain a log of all audit evidence requests as a record or drawn up flipchart/whiteboard/postit notes
        Consolidate requests from the audit team and present a single list to the auditees
        Evidence request can be managed through the daily debrief sessions
        Ensure the audit team maintains a record of what the have asked for and lead auditors need to present them this process prior to the audit
        

    Debriefing
        Is an opportunity to manage the audit process and to ensure the team delivers the audit outcomes
        The debrief should be held with the audit client and the team
        Do invite hosts or guides to help with the coordination
        Lead auditors have to decide whether to invite the irrelevant managers (Decide whether their attendance is required to meet the purpose of the debrief)
        The debrief aim should be made clear to the team and audit client before the audit starts and repeated at the start of the audit
        Otherwise, the debrief can become an extension of the auditing process
        Agenda includes:
            Evidence requests covering any new requests
            Requests for additional interviews
            Requests for additional site visits
            Confirmation oof the next day's auditing activities
            Agreement to the changes to the audit plan including auditor activities
            Audit questions, issues, observations, and findings
            Verification of progress against delivering the audit outcomes
            The audit client may want to understand the outcomes, so make it clear you are not able to draw conclusions until final analysis is completed
            Lead auditor is often pressurized by managers wanting to have an indication of how to audit is progressing
            Be careful not to be drawn into making any conclusions before completed gathering evidences
            
    Dealing with Conflicts
        Audits are usually an emotional experience for the auditee
        These emotions can boil into conflicts
        Conflicts are caused by different triggers
            Often miscommunication about findings and how they're interpreted
            Personality clashes between auditor and auditee
            Differences of professional opinion
        Conflicts has a potential to derail the audit process
        Lead auditor must manage conflicts and prevent them from damaging the audit outcomes
        Approach:
            Lead auditor must intervene in the discussion
            Request that the discussion is held in a separate location
            Inform each party that you are impartial and want to identify what the audit evidence is 
            Look for facts, separating fact from presumptions
            Look to see if the agreement reached is based on facts
            See if there are differences of opinion about the problem (ie how facts of situation create issues)
            Try to reach agreement on whether the evidence demonstrates a potential nonconformity issue
            If the agreement can be reached on potential consequences 
            It is useful to find the root cause at which the disagreement starts, either with facts, nonconformity, or consequences
            Assist to help the auditor and the auditor to find commond ground for the agreement
            Explain that the audit finding is not the conclusion
            If the agreement cannot be reached, then identify what the disagreement is about and record it in audit records
            Include point of disagreement in the auditclosing presentation and the report

10. Managing Your Audit Team

        https://advisera.com/27001academy/blog/2014/11/24/records-management-in-iso-27001-and-iso-22301/
        
    The importance of managing the audit team
        Lead Auditor takes responsibility for achieving the audit objectives
        To ensure objectives are delivered, audit team members have to work together coherently and coordinated in a way
        The team may include less experienced auditors who will need the leader's guidance, support and supervision
        More experienced auditors may need to be guided away from following their own established audit processes
        Good management of a team includes:
            Managing personal relationships and emotions
            Answering technical auditing subject matter
            Communications
            Project management skills
        The start of the audit management is not the day the audit starts but long before the audit scope, criteria and objectives were being discussed
        Understanding the objectives is key to the lead auditor's ability to meet them
        Understand the team's strengths, weaknesses and competencies
        Assign their tasks appropriately
        The audit will quickly fail without any leadership
        If the auditors dont understand their role in the audit plan, they will follow their own processes without the coordination with the other members
        Strike a balance between coordination and letting them follow their process by develoing the team's framework to allow auditors some freedom within that framework
        Example: Plan times for site visits but allow auditors to select the areas they want to visit
        Benefits of good team leadership:
            Effective planning, well structured, organized audit delivery makes the team comfortable and their efforts are not wasted
            It also makes the audit client to feel comfortable that the audit is being professionally carried out and will add value to that organization
    
    Communication with the team before audit
        Discussions can be held during audit planning
        Topics that must be discussed and agreed on with the auditors before starting the audit:
            Understand the competencies of the auditors via
                CVs, 
                Profiles
                Experiences with the auditee's industry and its operations
                Knowledge of the management system standard being audited
            Audit objectives, scope and criteria
            Audit plan and discuss any remote auditing techniques if applicable
            Logistics (ie accommodation, workspaces, travel, etc)
            Risks and any issues that need to be considered to manage the risks (ie security protocols, confidentiality, business processes)
            Safety issues (ie PPE)
            Any information and documentation, auditor might want to see prior to the audit 
                Organizational charts
                Data reports
                Evidence of actions to close previous nonconformances
                Maps
                Schematics
                Procedures, etc
        Lead auditors will coordinate in advance to request for the information with the audit client 
        Discussion will be held before the pre-audit discussion with the client
        Notify the audit team of the final agreed plan
        
    Managing audit progress
        Managing the progress is like managing the flow of information against time
        How the prorgess will be managed vary depending of the audit, existing procedures, experiences and confidence
        The information that need to be managed include:
            Evidence requests - those that are pending and those received
            Which document have been reviewed
            Progress with interviews - those that are pending and those completed
            Site visits - those that are pending and those completed
            Audit plan status - review and amend if needed
            Questions that are raised and those that have been answered
            A list of all audit evidence identified
            A list of findings identified by the team
        Use tools such as shared electronic documents, softwares, charts and notes to assist in managing the information
        Keep the flow of information visible and under control (ie using agile methods) in order to ease communications and coordination among the team
        Onsite stage of the audit falls into following steps:
            Opening meeting
            Evidence gathering (Site visits, interviews, document reviews, etc)
            Forming audit findings (Deciding if the evidence demonstrates nonconformity or an observation)
            Drawing audit conclusions (Based on nonconformities, does the company meet the ISO standards)
            Prepare for closing meeting 
            Presenting/delivery of the closing meeting
        Aim to allocate time for each of the step above and one method is to start from closing meeting and work the way backwards
        Opening and closing meetings are typically one hour
        Evidence gathering needs to be the bulk of the entire audit time (At least 75%)
        Make sure to allow adequate time to evaluate the audit evidence, agree on findings, and draw audit conclusions
        Allow adequate time at the end of the audit to prepare closing presentation (Depends on how efficient at preparing the materials needed - Templates, photos, etc)
        The non-tech savvy auditors may even prepare the presentation template the evening before
        Lead auditors must be realistic about their abilities and allow themselves time to prepare the best presentation they can

    Team Meetings
        There are times when the lead auditor need to pull back together the team
        Audit coordination, progress review and planning activities between team members require a separate time depending on team size
        Team meetings can be scheduled at any time but recommended at least once a day
        Typically the meeting will review the information from the audit
        Aim:   
            Update audit information
            Plan next activities
            Review necessary changes to the audit
        Team meetings should be kept seperate from the debriefing sessions that are held with audit clients
        Debriefing session is an opportunity to manage audit process with the client, share information and maintain communications
        Make sure that the audit team knows the differences between team meetings and debriefing sessions and both the purpose
        Knowing the difference prevent the team from holding general discussions about the evidence during debriefing sessions
        If the debrief and team meetings are mixed up, debriefing sessions can lose its purpose
        Plan time to have a debate between the auditors in team meetings

    Managing audit findings
        Pulling together the results of the audit team
        Different auditors may have different opinions and experiences about how they treat audit findings
            Example: How they word them or how they classify their significance
        To make sure you can use the findings to draw conclusions and present them to the audit client, it's best to find consistency in how they are presented
        A method to consistency is to develop a template for the auditors to record the findings against
        Example table:
            | Auditor                        | John Hancock                    |
            | Description of nonconformance  | Mgmt review not carried out     |
            | Evidence                       | Interview with QA Manager       | //Photos may be included
            | Criteria not met               | ISO9001, Clause 9.3 Mgmt Review |
        If the record is already existing in another document, then ensure that the team members are consistent with the way they are using them
        To achieve recording consistency, discuss audit findings at audit team meetings
        As group, apply peer review of each other's audit findings even when auditors are responsible for different areas of the audit
        Share evidence between auditors in support of each other's audit findings
        Draft and Finalized
            Recommended to consider audit findings as being in "draft" form until the debriefing session with audit client
            If there is an agreement with the audit findings, they can be considered "final"
        The debriefing session allows the audit client to provide additional evidence or clarify a misunderstanding
        This gives opportunity to prevent mistakes making sure findings are properly understood by the audit client
        A good practice is to avoid drawing audit conclusions before discussing the findings with the audit client
        Plan time to review findings with the audit client before drawing audit conclusions or closing meeting preparations        
        If the audit client didnt agree with the findings, be allowed the opportunity to raise objections
        Record any objections and include them in the closing presentation

    Managing audit records
        Aim of managing records is to demonstrate that the audit objectives have been met although there are auditors who skip this process
        There need to be a realistic balance between documenting every aspects of the audit and maintaining only appropriate records to achieve the audit objectives
        In some cases, it is possible to be creative with the way records are maintained to make this process easier
            Example: Take digital photos than hard copies OR use tools to keep track of audit information discussed in "Managing Audit Progress"
        Documentation developed during the audit includes
            Audit Plans
            Audit reports
            Non-conformity reports
            Auditor notes (Depends on the certification body)
            Photographs (Depends on the certification body)
            List of audit evidence (Depends on the certification body) ie document reviews, interviews, copies of closing presentation
            Post audit records includes 
                Corrections
                Corrective action plans
                Follow up audit records
        Challenges faced by Lead auditors
            Gathering all the audit records from the audit team
            Technologies such as shared files, software apps or cloud storage sites are sometimes being used to help this process
        Sometimes a separate list of audit documents is maintained by the lead auditor where all auditors are required to register their records on the list
            Each record will be given a unique reference number before being filed in a single audit folder
        Whatever process being used, it is best to occasionally check the auditors are following the process and discuss its use during team meetings

    What to do when you hit problems 
        Objectives, scope and criteria need certification body's approval prior to change
        There are many various issues that may arise and cause problems
            The audit client or auditees many not be sufficiently engaged with the audit process
            Auditors on medical leave
            Other unexpected circumsstances may arise
        The key is to understand how these issues could affect the achievement of the objectives
        It is best to follow a cascade approach to manage in such situations
            Try to manage the situation with the auditee and audit client locally (ie make some changes to the audit plan) 
            Reallocate other team members to other activities
            Reschedule interviews or meetings
            Aim to meet objectives without changing the scope or the criteria
            If the scope or criteria is still required to change, then contact the certification body (Check if the scope or criteria can be changed without changing the objectives)
            With the agreement of audit client, it may be possible to change the audit duration, reduce the area of the company being audited or change the criteria being audited against
            Onsite activities that were planned can be altered and then complete the rest of the audit using remote auditing techniques or offsite methods
        If nothing of the above can be achieved, then discuss with the certification body and possibly the audit client whether the objectives should be changed
        This may allow the lead auditor the flexibility to change the scope and criteria
        Consider either postponing or cancelling the audit as the last resort in the event of nothing can be done
        Postponement or cancellation can only be done after discussion with the certification body and the audit client
        The lead auditor's responsibility is to ensure the audit can be carried out adequately to meet audit objectives and to reach meaningful and realistic conclusions

    Evaluating your audit management
        Under ISO17012-1, auditors are required to be competent
        It is important and useful to develop a method to evaluate Lead Auditor competencies against requriements of ISO17021-1
        Should not be afraid to look for both formal and informal methods to appraise and improve the lead auditor skills
        Formal processes should already be in place within the certification body
        The factors includes the followings:
            How well you managed the audit team, allowing them to work to their strengths
            How well you developed an effective working relationship with them and between themselves
            How well you managed the audit process, keeping the process on track and responded to necessary changes
            How well you managed the interactions with the audit client
            How well the audit clients were able to receive the audit results
            How effective your communications were with the audit team, audit clients, auditees and the management team
            How effective was you closing meeting
            How well were audit conclusions reached in terms of accuracy and were they value added to the audit client
        You may also ask for feedback from the audit client, auditees, or the audit team members
        Consider what mistakes you can learn from them

    Audit Findings
        Audit findings are generated by comparing audit evidence against the requirements of the management system standard
        Depending on the scope, criteria of the audit, and the performance of the auditee, the audit team might generate several nonconformity audit findings or no evidence at all
        Lead auditor will find it uncomfortable at first with an audit with no findings however lead auditors must present a truthful and honest assessments
        As long as the objectives have been met, lead auditors must not measure their audit  performance based on the number of nonconformities found
        
        Audit Evidence >  Audit Findings >
            Conformity
            Opportunities for Improvement
            Nonconformity >
                Major
                Minor
            
        Major nonconformity is a state where the process not effective at achieving its intended outcomes (ie not conducting management reviews)
        Minor nonconformity is failure to meet a requirement but the intended outcome can still be achieved (Some people not taking up trainings)
            Multiple minor nonconformances of the same clause constitutes a major nonconformity (Alot of people not been trained)

    How to reach audit conclusions  
        It is the lead auditor's decision regarding whether the audit criteria have been met
        This includes the decision whether or not to recommend the organization for certification
        Without conclusion, audit results would only be consist of a list of non conformities
        It is common for non conformities to be single issues which can be fixed by corrective actions
        Audit conclusions tell the organization how effectively the management system meets the standard requirements
        Addressing the audit conclusion often requires more longer term systematic changes which prevents the reoccurrence of nonconformity in the future
        Conclusions should provide the audit client a clear indication  of the following
            Whether the organization has implemented an effective management system and is maintaining and improving it
            Level of conformance with the audit criteria
            How effective the management system is at achieving its stated objectives
        Certification body will have set criteria that the lead auditor should follow when deciding the conclusion
        Addressing major non conformity
            | Major nonconformity > Corr and CA Special audit > Corr and CA accepted and verified > no major non conformity
            | No certification >------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------> Certification
            NOTE: The audit can be on-site or offsite audit depending on the nature of the non-conformity and the type of evidence needed 
        Addressing minor nonconformity
            | Minor non conformity >-------------------> Plan for Corr and CA reviewed and accepted
            |                 >------------------------------------------------->   Certification
        
    Planning the closing meeting
        Gives an opportunity to influence the behavior of the management team and help them improve their management system
        If done correctly, closing meeting can trigger positive actions and improvements, trigger greater impact and generate more interest than the audit report
        If done badly, it will be a waste of people's time and end management engagement with the audit or the disciplines being audited
        Closing meetings are a mandatory requirement of every certification audit
        Invitees to the closing meeting at least include the management of the areas been audited
        Well delivered presentation should provide useful information and help management especially where there are issues that need to be addressed
        Plan the closing meeting in advance to allow time for the audit client to arrange the meeting
        Discuss when the closing meeting will take place during the initial contact with the audit client and who the invitees are going to be
        Repeat the agreed time of the closing meeting during openeing meeting so that everyone who attands the opening meeting is clear on this
        The closing meeting should be the final part of the audit happening on the last day
        Closing meetings should take about 30 minutes and not take more than one hour depending on the evidence that needs to be presented
        Plan the delivery of the audit so that all the auditing activities, drawn conclusions and presentation preparations for the closing meeting are all completed
        There should be no excuses for delaying or postponing the closing meeting
        Many auditors dont allow adequate time to prepare the closing meeting
        
    Holding an effective closing meeting
        Recommended to prepare a structure for the closing presentation that explains the audit conclusion
        Popwerpoint or other presentation software is a useful way of highlighting information
        Consider share photographs to explain the audit findings 
        Presentation structure:
            Introduce the audit team
            Describe the audit objectives, scope and criteria (Mandatory)
            Describe the evidence based sampling methods and mention the degree of uncertainty about the results (Mandatory)
            Describe the positivities about the organization
            Discuss the opportunities for improvement from the audit, especially the positive ones that will benefit the organization
            Highlight the evidence that support the findings of nonconformities (Present factually and objectively)
            2 options on how to present nonconformity:
                Present individual evidences and then describing them (Recommended)
                Present all the evidences in one go followed by all the nonconformities
            Describe how the audit conclusion being drawn based on the evidences, nonconformities raised, significance (major, minor)
            At the end of presentation, explain what the next steps are in the audit process and this includes:
                Certification body method and timescale in producing the audit report
                The process audit client should use to address any nonconformity (timescale for submitting plans, corrections and corrective actions)
                The processes of the certification body that will be carried out after the audit (ie certification review process or processes to plan the next audit)
                The process the audit client should use if they want to appeal or complain about the audit
                Reminding that the work being carried out is confidential
                
    Dealing with feedback at closing meetings
        There should be time to allow the audit client to ask questions at the end of the presentation
        This is to ensure the audit client has been kept informed of any issues or audit findings throughout the audit process
        Also to ensure audit client is aware of the audit conclusions
        There will be less likely there will be arguments against the audit during the presentation
        If there are still arguments, or disagreement regarding the nonconformities and conclusions, remain calm
        Keep answers focused on any points of facts that cannot be refuted
        Try to avoid getting into arguments
        If no information is given at the closing meeting, then explain that this is not presented to you during audit
        But the information can be considered after the audit (ie, When client put together their CA Plans)
        Also explain that any concerns or disagreements are recorded, documented and included in the report
        The certification body should have an appeals/dispute process and you should explain on how this can be used
        Your tone should be polite, factual BUT NOT APOLOGETIC
        If the audit highlighted poor management practice, lack of leadership or issues with management behavior, then these should be addressed using factual examples
        In these rare circumstances, it may be appropriate to create a sense of urgency or frustration with the results the company is achieving
        In usual non argumentative closing meetings, it is usual to use positive reinforcement 
            ie, to compare where the organization is achieving conformance with areas where it is lacking
            or generate a sense that there are positives but still areas of improvement
        If genuinely there are no further improvements can be made, then praise the company for this
        Many auditors feel uncomfortable having no nonconformities or opportunities for improvement to present
        If perfection is what you found, then the perfection of the company is what you present
        The presentation should present the facts clearly, openly and honestly, embedding the principles of auditing (Topic 6) 

    Effective Audit Report writing
        In most cases, the certification body will have a report template developed as part of the auditing procedures
        If there isn't any template, ISO17021 provides a list of contents that must be included in the report
        Under ISO17021, the followings must be in the report
            Name of the certification body and its accreditation number
            Name and address of the audit client
            Type of audit 
                Initial assessment, Stage 1, Stage 2, Surveillance, Recertification, etc
                Combined, Joined or Integrated Audit
            Audit objectives, scope and criteria
            Dates, departments and processes
            Details ofLead auditor, the audit team, technical specialists (if any)
            Anything that impacts future audits and certification body
            All nonconformities and opportunities for improvement, supporting audit evidence
            Audit conclusions
        Additional  
            Identify in the report if remote auditing techniques have been used during the audit
            Identify if there have been any disagreements about the audit findings and conclusions raised by the auditee
        When writing the report, ensure that the findings and evidences are presented clearly, factually and objectively
        Report simple fact and evidence 
        Avoid using the words like "should", "must", "have to", "needs to" as these are instruction based and opinion based words
            Example:
                Instead of "The security policy should be signed by the managing director"
                Write "The security policy was not signed by the managing director"
        Certification audit reports should not include any recommendations 
        Also avoid instructing the auditee on what they should do to address non conformities
        The report can include the opportunities for improvement but these must not be specific solutions
            Inappropriate Example: "Full time contracted staff should be included in the company's training program"
            Opportunity Example: "There is an opportunity to improve the training processes with the contractors"
        Audit client is always required to 
            Analyze the results of the audit, 
            Evaluate for themselves the root causes for nonconformity
            Develop appropriate corrections and corrective actions
        Audit conclusions for a certification audit should be a statement of the Lead Auditor's decision to recommend the organization for certification

    Post audit activities, corrections and correction actions
        Certification body's audit procedures should include a time period in which the report should be written 
        Also state down what to do if there is a delay in informing the client 
        The lead auditor will generate the report
        In some cases, the certification body's process is for the report to be written and issued to the audit client during site audit
        
        Activity steps generally taken by certification bodies
            Step 1: Issuing audit report
            Step 2: Audit client indentifies root causes and produces cerrections and corrective actions
            Step 3: Lead auditor reviews and approves the plan 
                Ensure they're appropriate to nonconformity raised (Timescale, responsibilities, clear actions)
            Step 4a: Minor nonconformity - Actions will be reviewed at next audit
            Step 4b: Major nonconformity - Lead auditor accepts and verifies actions through "Special audit" (onsite or remotely)
                Check if actions are sufficient for the major nonconformity to be downgraded to minor nonconformity or closed
            Step 5: Nonconformity closed
        
        Verifying actions
            The action is completed as planned
            Any evidence succeeded in addressing the nonconformity
            Assess whether the action achieved its purpose
                Example: 
                A company did not fully identify their environmental aspects and impacts 
                And their corrective actions was to develop an environmental aspects and impacts register
                Then verify that the register contained all the relevant environmental aspects and impacts
                This verification will be conducted at the next audit (planned audit or special audit)

    Certification review process
