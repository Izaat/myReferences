04. Analysis

    //The Department wanted to Classify the data into Nominal and Ordinal Categories   
    //Nominal data is categorized according to descriptive or qualitative information
            This indicates the relative importance of parameters under consideration

        #To examine the raw data to understand if gathered data is retrieved from normal distribution
        #Purpose is to check if data is from the Normal distribution
        #Test result will confirm whether to reject the hypothesis as non-normal data will produce misleading results
        
        #First step is to enter complaint details for any one service (High wait time is used for this example)
        #Data should be in ascending order according to time being recorded

                Title: Run Chart Example
        
        Run Chart will appear in a new window with each blue dot representing the waiting time
        From first dot to 300th, the wait time is about 45 to 80
        But from 300th to 400th dots, there is a jump to 180 to 200 in waiting time
        At 400th to 500th, wait time drops to 120-ish
        500th to 680th, Wait time variation is 50 to 180
        
        From the data above, we conclude that there is alot of variance in the data before improvement
        After realizing the variances, assess the data for its symmetry/skewness.
        This can be done with Histogram
            
    #Histogram

        A window with Histogram will appear
        Interpretation:
            Horizontal axis represents wait time duration
            Vertical axis (Frequency) represents the number of patients
            The highest peak in the graph shows 80 patients waited for 60 minutes
            The distribution is positively skewed since the peak is on the left side of the graph

        Interpretation of Continuous Data Chart
            2 charts generated, Individual Value and Moving Range
            Vertical Axis is the Wait Time, Horizontal Axis is the patient by index number
            Under Individual Value Chart, Patient 20 hits the upper limit (UCL) of wait time
            Under Moving Range Chart, the vertical axis is the excess time (Note the 0-3 on the vertical axis)
                Patient 20 and 21 is beyond the UCL but under individual chart, patient 21 wait time is around the Xbar
                This means that patient 20's excessive waiting time affected patient 21 waiting time
