                Supports the Black Belts by working on the project
                Dual role with performing designated day-to-day jobs

        #Organizational Drivers and Metrics
            Balanced Scorecard (BSC) offers strategic implementation and performance measurement
            BSC translates organizational strategy into actionable objectives
            BSC provides a framework for performance measurement

        #Balanced Scorecard:
            Helps clarify organizational vision and mission
            Provides feedback on business processes and external outcomes
            Enables continuous improvement with respect to organizational goals
            Integrates organizational strategy with key metrics from 4 major areas of performance (Four Box Model)
                Finance, 
                Customer Relations, 
                Internal Processes 
                Learning and growing

        #Developing BSC:
            Interactions between perspectives or business units have to onsidered to prevent uneven optimization.
                Strategic Objectives: 3 or 4 objectives have to be agreed upon >
                Measures to access progress (Should be closely related to performance drivers) >
                Targets for each measure > 
                Initiatives requires to achieve each target

        #Four box Model of BSC  
            Financial > Learning & Growth > Internal Processes > Customer > Repeat

        #Strategy Maps
            A chain of cause and effect relationships between the perspectives are represented by interlinked objectives in strategy map
            A one page view of how the organization can create value
            Function is to outline what the organization wants to accomplish and how it plans to accomplish

            Example Table:
            # Financial        | Lower cost     >  Increase Profitability   <     Increase Revenue
            #                  |      ^                                                 ^
            # Customer         |      ^            Lower wait Time          >     Improve Customer Retention
            #                  |      ^                                                 ^
            # Internal Process | Increase Process Efficiency                >     Lower Cycle Time
            #                  |      ^
            # Learn & Growth   |  Improve Knowledge, Tools and Technology

        #Impact on Organization
            BSC and strategy map forces managers to consider cause and effect relationships leading to >
                Better identification of drivers
                Well rounded approach to strategic planning
            BSC improves:
                Communications and understandings at all levels of organization
                Quality of decision making by managing information
                Structured approach to reporting progress by creating performance reports against a balanced scorecard
                Enables organization to communicate performance transparently and meaningfully
                BSCs can be cascaded into each business unit enabling direction to work towards the common organizational goal

    #Lean Principles
        #The 3 Focuses
            Muda: Non-value added work
            Mura: UnevennessVariations
            Muri: Overburden

        #Muda - The 7 types of Wastes
            Transport
            Inventory
            Motion
            People: 
            Waiting            
            Overprocessing
            Overproduction            
            Defects/Repairs/Rejects
            
            Other wastes:
                Underutilization of skills and manpower
                    Not assigning right people for the right task
                    Below optimum use of workforce capabilities
                Underperforming processes
                    Automation of poorly performing processes
                    Improving a process that should be eliminated
                    Asymmetry in processes that should be eliminated

        #Lean Process Steps:
            Identify what customers wants
            Understand what the process should have to meet customer requirements

        #Pull vs Push Process
            Push Method (Pharmacy)
                Forecast demand
                Build stock
                Wait for customers to buy
            Pull Method (Tesla Motors)
                Get customer demand
                Start production
                Deliver to customer

        #Theory of Constraints
            Question:
                The 3 subprocess of packing process: Print > Filling > Sealing
                Data for 3 subprocesses measured and collected as number of units produced per hour
                    Print: 900 pc/hr
                    Fill: 720 pc/hr
                    Seal: 780 pc/hr
                How to implement TOC Method?
                
            Answer:
                TOC Map: 5 steps pie
                    Step 1: Filling is the constraint since it's the lowest number
                    Step 2: Performance of constaint is then analyzed by data 
                        Assigning repair and maintenance labor force monitor
                    Step 3: Carry out the maintenance of filling machine
                    Step 4: Remove defects from filling machine
                    Step 5: Repeat to step one and identify system constraint

                Before TOC
                    Print: 900 pc/hr
                    Fill : 720 pc/hr
                    Seal : 780 pc/hr
                    
                After TOC
                    Print: 900 pc/hr
                    Fill : 840 pc/hr
                    Seal : 780 pc/hr

        #IDOV VS DMADV
            IDOV
                Used for designing new product/service
                Design new process
            DMADV
                Used for designing new or existing product/service
                Redesign existing process

        #QFD (Quality Function Deployment) / VOC (Voice of Customer) / HOQ (House of Quality)
            A predefined method of identifyingcustomerrequirements
            A systematic process to understand the needs of customer and convert them into a set of design and manufactureing requirements
            Motivates businesses to focus on customers 
            Helps design products that are competitive in lesser time and cost
            Identifies which customer's needs are the most important
            Identifies strangths and weaknesses of the system
            
            Necessary to ask customers relevant questions and tabulate a set of parameters critical to the product design as data
            Required to understand the effects of failures to ensure preventive actions are taken to be able to answer to the customer
        
        #FMEA
            Helps focus attention on critical areas in a system
            Drawbacks of FMEA is that it does not give solutions to the identified problem
            Applied on the output of root cause analysis
            Tool for focus or prioritization
            
            #PFMEA
                Used onnew orexisting process to uncover potential failures
                Done in the quality planning phase to act as an aid during production
                Involves fabrication, assembly, transactions or services
                
            #DFMEA
                Used in design of a new product to uncover potential failures
                Aimed at identifying failures and reduce them
                Done before product is sent to manufacturing
                All design deficiencies would be resolved at the end of this process

            #RPN (Risk priority Number)
                The higher the number, the higher the criticality
                RPN = Severity x Occurences x Detectability
                Max value = 1000
                
            #Severity
                How severe the failure is to the customer

            #Occurence 
                The probability that a cause will result in the particular failure mode

            #Detection
                The probability that a particular symptom to failure will be found 
                Max value = 10 = Undetectable/Uncertainty

02. Define Phase

    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    #Project Identification
        #Prerequisites of a project
            01. Is there an existing process
            02. Is there a problem in the process
            03. Is the problem measureable: 
                This is needed since data is needed to assess the root cause
                And the impact of the problem
            04. Does the problem impact customer satisfaction
            05. Does working on the problem impact the profits of the company
            06. Is the root cause of the problem unknown
                IF the root cause is visible, it is not required to do a six sigma project
            07. Is the solution unknown
                If the solution is know, there is no need for the project

        #Define Phase Objectives
            Define problem statement through customer Analysis
            Define the objectives of the Project
            Plan time, budget and resource requirements for the project
            Define roles and responsibilities in the team structure

        #Benchmarking
            A process of comparing an organization's business processes, practices and performance metrics with industry leaders
            Types of benchmarking
                Process benchmark: Compare with a leading company
                Financial benchmark: Detailed financial analysis and compare on overall competitiveness and produtivity
                Performance benchmark: Compare products and services with the competitors
                Product benchmark: Designing new or upgrading existing product/services. Involves reverse engineering of their products.
                Strategic benchmark: Studying strategies and problem solving approaches in other industries
                Functional benchmark: Focused analysis of a single function with the aim of improving it
                Competitive benchmark: Standardizing organizational strategies, process, products, services, procedures with competitors
                Collaborative benchmark: Standards carried out by a group of companies where information is shared
            Best Practices
                A method that ensures continuous improvement, leading to exceptional performance
                Increase the objectives or scope of benchmarking
                Set standards and path to be followed at the initial stage
                Reduce unnecessary effort and comply with scope
                Recognize the best in the industry to set a benchmark
                Share the information derived from benchmarking

            Business System > Business Process > Process
                Business System:
                    Value added chain of various business processes
                    Example: The company
                Business Process:
                    Systematic organization of objects into work activities to produce service/product
                    The manufacturing department under a company
                Process:
                    Series of steps to produce a service or product
                    Consists of input, process, and output
                    Manufacturing Cell Team under the manufacturing department 

            Challenges of Business Process Improvement
                The traditional business system structure causes challenges on business process improvement
                Product or service has to go through various functions and their functional elements to reach the customer
                Management of the flow of products or services across various functional elements is difficult

            Hierarchy:
                Process Owner > Stakeholder > 
                    Stockholders
                    Customers
                    Suppliers
                    Management
                    Employees
                    Society
                    
                Process Owner   
                    Responsible for the performance and execution of the process
                
                Stakeholder:
                    People who are affected by the organization's actions

            Effects of Process Failure on Stakeholders
                Failure to meet one or more process objectives results in negative effects on stakeholders
                Stockholders:   Reduction in perceived value for the company
                Customers:      May seek competitor's product and find legal recourse
                Suppliers:         May face delay in receiving their pay or non-payment issues
                Management:  May require cost cut-down
                Employees:      Will receive diminishing wages
                Society:            May experience pollution due to the organization

            Stakeholder Analysis
                An important task to be completed before doing a Six Sigma project
                A business has many stakeholders and anny change to a business process affects some or all of them
                When a process does not meet its objectives, it results in a stakeholders being negatively affected, 
                    which in turn impacts the organization's performance
                The Six Sigma team must factor in the reasons why a stakeholder may oppose the change effort

    #Customers: 2 types of customers
        Internal
        External
        
        Internal Customers
            Anyone within the business system who is affected by the product or services while it is being developed
            Activities that directly impact final customers
            Activities that directly affect the next process in the system
            Activities that affects the quality of the end product

        Collecting customer data/feedback
            Data/Feedbacks is collected from internal and external customers
            It fills the gaps and improve the various business processes in the organization
            Helps to define a good quality product as perceived by the customer
            Identifies what qualities make the competitior's products or service better
            Identifies the factors that provide a competitive edge to the product or service
            
            Method:
                Surveys
                Focus Groups
                Individual interviews
                Direct feedback (emails, forms, call centre data, etc)

        Translate Customer Requirements
            Data collected from customers that gives information on what they need or want from the process
            Are often high level, vague and non-specific. But a reflection of their experience
            When translated into critical process requirements that are specific and measureable, they are called Critical To Quality (CTQ) factors
            
        The 4 elements of CTQ (Critical To Quality)
            Output characteristis
            Y metrics
            Targets
            Specification/tolerance limits

        QFD (Quality Function deployment)
            A process to understand the customer's needs
            Translates customer's needs into a set of design and manufacturing reuirements
            Motivates businesses to focus on customers
            Helps to design and build more competitive products in lesser time at lower cost
            Helps recognize strength and weaknesses of the organization
            Helps understand areas where most of the work is to be done
            Helps to understand where the focus should be
            
        QFD Phases:
            #Phase 1 :  Customer requirements     >         Product Planning        >           Technical requirements

            Project Scope
                Interpreted from problem statement and project charter
                Tools used for interpretation of project scope:
                    Pareto Chart:
                        Assists to narrow the scope of the project by indentifying the causes that have major impact on the outcomes
                    SIPOC:
                        A high level process map which helps to understand the process functions at the supplier, input, process, output and customer level

        #Process Maps
            A micro level flow chart that provides an in-depth detail of a process
            The process map covers details at all levels 
            Provides a walk through experience (From supplier to eternal customer)
            Used as a blueprint while drawing a process map
            Final process map drills further into details

            Process/Consequential Metrics
                Measures the negative effects of improving the primary or the key metrics
                Used for measuring indemnity triggered by any damage in the project
                Inconsistent use of  consequential metrics can lead to a loss of opportunity and rework after project ends
                Helps to understand the cause and effect relationship between the primary and the secondary metrics and the impact on organization

            Consequential Metrics - Best Practices
                Using consequential metrics during measure phase  and monitor after project finalization
                    Helps to analyze whether the link between previous primary and secondary metrics has been established
                Consequential metrics + Primary metrics + Secondary metrics = Provides clarity  
                Assessing and evaluating the cause and effect relationship between these metrics helps the organization

            Project Planning Tools
                Pareto Chart
                Network Diagrams
                CPM - Critical Path Method
                PERT - Program Evaluationn and Review Technique

            Pareto Chart (80/20 Rule)
                A histogram depicting the frequency of occurences
                Plots all causes for defets in a product or service
                80% of effects comes from 20% of causes
                Narrows the scope of the project/problem solving by identifying the major causes

            Network Diagrams/Arrow Diagram
                A diagram that uses arrows to connect activities and represent precedence and interdependencies between activities of a project
                Assumptions made while drawing the Network Diagram:
                    Before new activity begines, all pending activities have been completed
                    The direction of arrow represents teh sequence that activities need to follow
                    Must start from a single evene and end with a single event
                
                Terms
                To calculate the total duration of the project, four dates for each task must be defined
                    Early Start: Earliest start date of task
                    Late Start: Last date by when the task should start
                    Early Finish: Earliest date the task can be completed
                    Late Finish: Last date the task should be completed

                Duration of Task
                    Difference between the early start and early finish of the task
                    Slack Start Time = Late Start - Early start
                    Slack Finish Time = Late Finish - Early Finish

                CPM - Critical Path Method
                    Used to monitor the progress of a project and ensure that the project is on schedule
                    The longest sequence of tasks on the network diagram
                    Tasks on the critical path have zero slack
                    Resources from tasks that are not on critical path can be diverted to critical task path (To prevent delay)

        #Project Evaluation and Review Techniques - Risks
            An uncertain event or consequence that will probably occur during a project
            Impacts at least one of 4 main objectives (Time, Cost, Quality, Scope)
            Positive risks enhance the success of the project
            Negative risks pose a threat to a project's success
            
            Terms:
                Risk Probability       : Likelihood that a risk will occur. Assessing risk is assessing probability and impact of the risk
                Issue                       : The occurence of risk
                Risk Consequences: Effects on project objectives if there is an occurence of a risk or issue

            #Elements
                Qualitative method - Interviews, checklists, brainstrming - used to identify risks
                Quantitative method - Evaluate the cost, time and probabilisti combination of individual uncertainties
                Feasibility - The study of project risk
                Potential Impact - Determining the impact of potential risks on a project
                RPN - Probability of occurence, severity and detectability
                Avoiding Risk - If the potential impact is huge, then avoiding is the best option
                Mitigating risk - Loss from mitigating a risk is much less than loss from temporarily avoiding the risk
                Accepting risk - If risk cannot be avoided or mitigated, then it has to be accepted (If it doesnt greatly impact cost, time and product objective)

            #Risk assessment matrix

            #Project Closure
                Without formal closure process, project team can fail to recognize the end and the project will drag on at great expense
                Each phase of the project must have closure process
                Outcomes:
                    Outcomes match the stated goals of the project
                    Customers and stakeholders are happy with the results
                    Critical knowledge is captured
                    Team feels a sense of completion
                    Project resources are released for new projects
                Closure Report Goals:
                    Review and validate the success of the project
                    Confirm outstanding issues, limitations and recommendations
                    Outline tasks and activities accompanied to complete the activity
                    Highlight the best practices for future projects
                    Provide the project report/summary
                    Provide project background overview

    #Business Results for Projects
        #Throughput Yield (TPY)
            Only be used to measure single process
            The number of acceptable pieces at the end of a process divided by the number of start pieces
            The start pieces excludes scrap and rework

        #If DPU (Defects pr unit) is known, TPY can be calculated
            TPY = e^-DPU    (e to the power of -DPU)
            DPU = -loge (TPY), where e = 2.7183

        #Rolled Throughput Yield (RTY)
            Probability of the entire process producing zero defects
            Important as a metric when a process has excessive rework
            A measure of efficency
        
            TDPU (Total Defects per Unit) defined for a set of processes
                RTY = e^-TDPU (e to the power of -TDPU)
                TDPU = -loge(RTY)
            
            RTY is the product of FPY (First Pass Yield) when the defects are known
            FPY is the number of products which pass without any reork over total number of units 
                FPY = (Total Units - Defects) / Total Units
                       = Total Quality Unit / Total Units
                       
                RTY = FPY1 * FPY2 * FPY3 * ... * FPYn

        #Cp - Process Capability
            Inherent variability of a characteristic of a process or product
            An indicator of the capability of a process
            Sigma is the standard deviation of a process
            Cp = (USL-LSL) / 6sigma
            Difference between USL and LSL is called Specification width or Tolerance

        #Cpk - Process Capability Indices
            To objectively measure the degree to which a process meets or does not meet customer rquirements
            To calculate Cpk, first is to determine if the process mean is closer to LSL or USL
            If closer to LSL, then Cpkl is determined
                Cpkl = (Xbar - LSL) / (k * sigma), //The k value is usually 3 but depends on industry standards Sigma value is std dev.
                    Xbar = Process Average
                    Sigma = Standard Deviation
            If closer to USL, then Cpku is determined
                Cpku = (USL - Xbar) / (3 * sigma), //The k value is usually 3 but depends on industry standards. Sigma value is std dev.
                    Xbar = Process Average
                    Sigma = Standard Deviation
            If the process mean is equidistant, either one of the limit (USL or LSL) can be chosen
            Cpk takes up the value of Cpku and Cpkl depending on whichever is the lower value
            
            Calculation Example 01:
                A normal distibution curve where the ends bleeds out from the LSL and USL
                Xbar = 10, sigma = 0.5, k=3
                LSL = 9, USL = 11
                
                Cpk = { [(Xbar-LSL) / (k*sigma) ], [(USL-Xbar) / (k*sigma)]
                Cpk = { [(10-9) / (3*0.5)], [(11-10) / (3*0.5)] }  = 0.667
                Therefore, process is not capable
                
            Calculation Example 02:
                Consider the capability process that puts pressurized grease in an aerosol can.
                Design spec calls for 60psi for each can with USL of 65psi and LSL of 55psi.
                A sample is taken from production and found average  pressure at 61psi (Xbar=61) with std dev of 2psi
                Since Std Dev is 2, therefore, Sigma value is at 2.
                1. Is the Process capable at 3 sigma level?
                        Cpk = { [(Xbar-LSL) / (k*sigma) ], [(USL-Xbar) / (k*sigma)]
                        Cpk = { [(61-55) / (3*2)], [(65-61) / (3*2)] }  = 1, 0.667 (Take the lowest value among the 2)
                        Therefore process is not capable at 3 sigma
                2. What is the probability of producing defect?
                        P(defect) = P(X<55) + P(X>65)
                        =P(X<55) + 1 - P(X>65)  #The 1 here is the standard rule whole number
                        = P(Z<(LSL-Xbar)/sigma) + 1 - P(Z<(USL-Xbar)/sigma)     #This converts X to Z
                        =P(Z<(55-61)/2) + 1 - P(Z>(65-61)/2)
                        =P(Z<-3) + 1 - P(Z<2)
                        = G(-3) + 1 - G(2)
                        = 0.0013 + 1 - 0.9772 (Taken from std normal probabilities table), https://castle.eiu.edu/~aalvarado2/z_table.pdf
                        =0.0241
                        Therefore, 2.4% of cans are defective
                3. Another process has sample mean of 60.5 with std dev of 3. Which of these 2 process is more accurate?
                        Cpk = { [(Xbar-LSL) / (k*sigma) ], [(USL-Xbar) / (k*sigma)]
                        Cpk = { [(60.5-55) / (3*3)], [(65-60.5) / (3*3)] }  = 0.611, 0.5 (Take the lowest value among the 2)
                        Therefore process is not capable at 3 sigma                        
                4. Which of the Process is more consistent?
                        P(Z<(55-60.5)/3) + 1 - P(Z>(65-60.5)/3)
                        =P(Z<-1.83) + 1 - P(Z<1.5)
                        =G(-1.83) + 1 - G(1.5)
                        =0.0336 + 1 - 0.9332
                        =0.1004
                        Therefore, 10% of cans are defective
                Conclusion, the smaller the sigma value, the better the process
        
        #Cpk and Cp Interpretations
            **Memorize
                If Cp < 1, then the process is not capable, to confirm the capability, check Cpk value
                If Cpk < 1, then the process is confirmed not capable
                If Cpk < 1 but with Cp > 1, process might be capable. 
                Cpk will almost always be lesser than Cp when Xbar is at the center of range
                If Cpk >= 1, then the process is capable
                Non centering of Xbar can happen when the process has not understood customer expectations clearly
                Non centering of Xbar can also happen when the process is complete as soon as the output reaches a specific limit

    #Team Dynamics and Performance
        There are 5 stages in team building process
        Each team passes through them as they start and proceed through the project
            Forming
            Storming
            Norming
            Performing
            Adjourning

        #Forming
            Team comes together and team leader directs and assigns responsibilities to them
            Leader employs a directive style of management
            To move to the next stage, the team should: 
                Achieve a commitment to the project 
                Acceptance of common purpose

        #Storming
            Conflicts start to arise within the team
            Team members struggle over responsibilities and control
            Responsibilities of the leader to pacify and coach the team
            Leader employs coaching style of management
            To move to the next stage, the team should: 
                Know how to voice disagreement openly and constructively 
                while staying focus on common objectives and areas of agreement

        #Norming
            Team develops a unified commitment to the project goal
            Leader promotes the team and participates in team activities
            Team members look to the leader for clarification 
            Leader employs a participatory style of management through: 
                Facilitating change
                Working towards consensus
                Overseeing quality control
            To move to the next stage, the team should: 
                Accept individual responsibilities and work out agreements about team procedures

        #Performing
            The most productive stage of project team evolution
            Team members manages complex tasks and work toward the common goal
            Leader employs a supervisory style of management by:
                Overseeing progress
                Rewarding an achievement
                Supervising process
                Leader leaves the project in automated mode
            To move to the next stage, the team should complete the project successfully
            
        #Adjourning
            The project is winding down and the goals are within reach
            Team members are dealing with their impending seperation from the team
            Leader provides feedback to the team
            Leader employs suppportive style of management
                Providing feedback
                Celebrating accomplishments
                Providing closure
            Leader needs to adapt to different style of management at every stage
            Leader must identify the current stage the team is in
            The success of the team depends on how well the leader guides them through these phases

            Sample Space: Collection of all possible outcomes
            Venn Diagram: Shows all hypothetically possible logical relations between a finite collection of sets
            Event: A collection of outcomes, any subset of the sample space

        Basic Properties
            Independent Events
                When the probability of an event does not affect the probability of another event
            Dependent Events
                When the probability of an event affects the probability of another event
            Mutually Exclussive Events
                When an outcome prevents another outcome from happening
            Mutually Inclusive Events
                When one outcome cannot occur without the other

        Multiplication Rules of AND Rules
            Depends on the event dependency:
            
            If events are independent (Events A, B, C, etc, are independent)
                P(A & B & C & ... ) = P(A) * P(B) * P(C) * ...
                Probability of Occurrence for flipping a coin to get a head, drawing a card to get Ace, and throwing a dice to get 1
                P(A) * P(B) * P(C) = (1/2) * (1/13) * (1/6) = 0.0064 = 0.64%

            If events are dependent (Events A and B are two dependent events)
                P(A with B) = P(A) * P(B|A)
                Probability of drawing 2 silver coins from a bag of 6 gold coins and 4 silver coins
                P(A) = 4/10     //Event where first coin is silver
                P(B|A) = 3/9    //Event where second coin is silver. 9 coins left in the bag inclusive of 3 silver coins
                P(A) * P(B|A) = (4/10) * (3/9) = 12/90 = 0.1334 = 13.34%
                P(A with B) = P(A) * P(B|A)
                P(A with B) = 13.34%

        Permutation and Combination
            Permutation:
                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DROZVHObeko
                Total number of ways which a set, group, or number of things can be arranged
                nPr = p(n, r) = (n!) / [(n-r)!]
            Combination:
                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8vIcmr_Pqo
                The unordered arrangement of a set, group, or number of things
                nCr = c(n, r) = (n!) / [r!(n-r)!]

        Calculation:
            From a group of 10 employees, a company has to select 4 for a project.
            How many ways can the selection happen when the arrangement of employees:
                a. needs to be different
                b. need not be different 
                
            Answer for (a):
                nPr = p(n, r) = (n!) / [(n-r)!]
                10 P 4 = (10!) / [(10-4)!] = 10! / 6! = 10x9x8x7 = 5040 ways
            
            Answer for (b):
                nCr = c(n, r) = (n!) / [r!(n-r)!]   //Binomial coefficient
                10 C 4 = c (10, 4) = (10!) / [4!(10-4)!] 
                = (10x9x8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1) / [4! x 6!]
                = (10x9x8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1) / [4x3x2x1 x 6x5x4x3x2x1]
                = (10x9x8x7) / [4x3x2x1]  #6! have been cancelled with the numerator
                = (10x9x8x7) / [4x3x2]  #Cancelled 1 from denominator
                = (10x9x4x7) / [4x3]  #Cancelled 2 from denominator
                = (10x3x4x7) / [4]  #Cancelled 3 from denominator
                = (10x3x7)  #Cancelled 4 from denominator
                = 210 ways
 
        Types of Statistics
            Refers to science of collection, analysis, interpretations and presentation of data
            1. Descriptive Statistics aka Enumerative Statistics
                    Organizing, Summarizing and Presenting data
                    Describes what is going on in the data
                    Tools: Histograms, PieCharts, BoxPlots, MeanMedianMode
            2. Inferential Statistics aka Analytical Statistics
                    Predicting and Drawing conclusions
                    Concluding the data to more general conditions
                    Tools: Hypothesis Testing, Scatter Diagram


        Calculation:
            Statistically proving the improvement of a team after recruiting a new coach
            Ya = Efficiency of Coach A
            Yb = Efficiency of Coach B
            
            Null Hypothesis: Assuming both A and B are effective
                H0: Ya = Yb
            
            Alternate Hypothesis: Assuming efficiencies of both coaches differ
                H1: Ya != Yb

        Types of Errors
            Two possible errors when collecting data
            Type 1 Error:
                Aka Producers Risk
                When H0 is rejected when it is true
                Chance of producing Type 1 error is known as Alpha
                Max chance to commit Type 1 error is 5%
            Type 2 Error:
                Aka Consumers Risk
                When null hypothesis is accepted when it is actually false
                Chance of producing Type 2 error is known as Beta
                Max chance to commit Type 2 error is 20%

        Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNm3M9cqWyc
            For a sample size greater than 30, the plotted sample mean tends to look more like normal distribution
            Standard Error Mean (SEM) = (Population Standard Deviation) / (Square Root of Sample Size)
            Selecting a sample size also depends on "Power of Test"
            Sampling distributions are helpful in dealing with non-normal data
            If sample data points are taken, and the distribution of means of samples is plotted, it is called the sampling distribution of means
            Sampling distribution will approach normality as the sample size increases
            Mean of the sampling distribution equals to the population mean
            Helps in making inferences from sample statistics about the population parameters irrespective of the distribution of the population
            The basis for calculating the confidence interval for a hypothesis test as it allows the use of a standard normal table

        #Discrete Distribution
            Binomial Distribution
                Describes the distribution of binary data from repeated events (Probability is defined)
                Describes the discreet data as a result of a particular process
                Bernoulli's process where it has only 2 outcomes (Good or Reject, Pass or Fail, etc..)
                Being used to deal with defects
                Most suitable when sample size is less than 30 and less than 10% of population
                P(R) = nCr * p to the power of r * [(1-p) to the power of n-r]  
                    where: p = probability of success, r = number of successes desired, n = sample size

            Binomial Distribution Calculation
                Question: Find probability of getting 5 heads in 8 coin tosses
                Answer:
                    Outcomes are statistically independent (Head or Tail)
                    p = 0.5 or 50% chance
                    n = 8 (sample size)
                    r = 5 (number of success desired)
                    
                    P(R) = nCr * p^r * (1-p)^n-r
                    P(R) = 8C5 * 0.5^5 * (1-0.5)^8-5
                    = c(8,5) * 0.03125 * 0.125
                    = (8!) / [5!(8-5)!] * 0.03125 * 0.125
                    = (8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1) / [(5x4x3x2x1)(3x2x1)] * 0.03125 * 0.125
                    = (8x7x6) / [(3x2x1)] * 0.03125 * 0.125
                    = (8x7x6) / [(3x2)] * 0.03125 * 0.125
                    = (8x7x2) / [(2)] * 0.03125 * 0.125
                    = (8x7) * 0.03125 * 0.125
                    = 56 * 0.03125 * 0.125
                    = 0.2187
                    = 21.87%

            Poisson Distribution
                Describes the distribution of binary data from randomly occurring events (Undefined probability)
                Used for analyzing situtations where the number of failure/defects is large or probability of success is undefined or very small
                Widely used in insurance sector for calculating accidents (a randomly occuring event)
                
                P(x) = {Lambda^x * e^Lambda) / x!
                where P(x) = probability of exactly (*) occurrences in Poisson Distribution (n)
                Lambda = mean number of occurrences during interval
                x = number of occurrences desired
                e = base of the natural logarithm (equals 2.71828)
                
                Mean of PD (u) = Lambda
                Std Dev of Poisson Distr. (sigma) = Sqrt of Lambda

            Poisson Distribution Calculation
                Past record shows the number of accidents every week = 5 junction related accidents in a week
                Assume number of accidents follows Poisson Distribution.
                Calculate probability any number of accidents in a week
                
                Lambda = 5 per week
                Probability of 0 accidents per week
                    P(0) = [5^0 * e^-5] / 0! = 0.006
                Probability of exactly 1 accident per week
                    P(1) = [5^1 * e^-5] / 1! = 0.03
                Probability of more than 2 accidents per week
                    P(2) = [5^2 * e^-5] / 2! = 0.08
                    1 - [P(0) + P(1) + P(2)] = 1 - [0.006 + 0.03 + 0.08]
                    = 0.884
                    = 88.4%
        
        #Continuous Distribution
            Normal/Gaussian Distribution
                A continuous probability distribution
                Illustrated as N (mu, sigma)
                Higher frequency arounf the mean and fewer away from it (Bell curve and symmetrical)
                Used as a first approximation to describe real valued random variables that cluster around the mean
                Total area under normal curve: p(x) = 1
                To standardize comparison of dispersion, a standard Z variable is used
                
                Uses of Z value:
                    Unique for each probability within normal distribution
                    Helps to find probabilities of data points anywhere within the distribution
                    Dimensionless (Not defined in S.I Units like mm, liters, etc)
                    
                    Z = (Y-mu) / sigma
                    where Z = number of standard deviation between Y and mu
                    Y = value of the data point in concern
                    mu = mean of population
                    sigma = standard deviation of population

            Normal Distribution Calculation
                #Calculation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tuBREK_mgE
                #Z-Table: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgwT6tDniko
                Time taken to resolve customer problems follows normal distribution
                Mean value of time = 250hours
                Standard Deviation = 23hours
                Find the probability that a problem resolution will take 300hours
                
                Y = 300
                mu = 250 
                sigma = 23 
                Formula:
                    Z  = (Y-mu) / sigma
                        = (300 - 250) / 23
                        =2.17
                Bell Curve Diagram: 
                    The Z table required
                    From Normal Distribution Table, Z value of 2.17 covers an area of 0.98499
                    Thus the probability that a problem can be resolved in less than 300 hours is 98.5%
                    The chances of a problem resolution taking more than 300 hours is 1.5%
                
            Z Table calculation:        
                Find the p of (Z greater than 1.12)            
                    Opposite of event A occurrence is the event not occurring.
                    P(not A) = 1 - P(A)
                    P(Z greater than 1.12) = 1 - P(Z less than 1.12)
                    Using table:
                    P(Z<1.12) = 0.5 + P(0 < Z < 1.12) = 0.5 + 0.3686 = 0.8686
                    Hence P(Z>1.12) = 1 - 0.8686 = 0.1314
                    
                Find value of p of (Z between 0 and 1.12)
                    Can be read straight from the table
                    Using Table:
                    P(Z between 0 and 1.12) = 0.3686

            Chi Square Distribution (X^2 distribution)
                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80ffqpZdKiA
                A distribution of the sum of squares of k independent standard normal random variables
                Widely used probability distribution in inferential statistics
                Used in hypothesis tests
                Degree of freedom (dof) = k - 1, where k is the sample size

                Formula:
                    X^2 = Sum = [(f0 - fe)^2] / fe
                    where, X2 calculated (Sum) = chi-squared index
                    f0 = observed frequency
                    fe = expected frequency

                Graph Shape:
                    Normal Distribution (Z1) = Bell shaped
                    Chi Squared (Xsq1) means Normal distribution (Z1) being squared (Zsq1), hence "Chi-Squared" and this will be 1 degree of freedom
                    Chi-squared with 1 dof (Xsq1) AKA Zsq1 = Steep descending slope from peak at 0, reversed exponential graph
                    Chi squared with 2 dof (Xsq2) OR, Zsq1 + Zsq2 = Gradual descending slope from peak at 0
                    Chi squared with 3 dof (Xsq3) OR, Zsq1 + Zsq2 + Zsq3 = Steep ascending slope from 0, peaks at 1 and then gradual descending slope
                    Chi squared with 4 dof (Xsq4) OR, Zsq1 + Zsq2 + Zsq3 + Zsq4 = Slight gradual ascending slope from 0, peaks at 2 and then gradual descending slope
                    Chi squared with 5 dof (Xsq5) = More gradual ascending slope from 0, peaks at 3 and then gradual descending slope

            t-Distribution
                Used in hypothesis testing
                Symmetrical in shape (Bell curve)
                Used when: 
                    The sample size is less than 30
                    The population standard deviation is not known
                    population is approximately normal
                t-Distribution approaches Normal Distribution as sample size increases
                In t-Distribution, when sample size is 15, 
                    the mean peak will be lower than Normal Distribution's peak but higher than the mean peak of t-Distribution's with sample size of 2
                    tails will be higher than Normal Distribution's tails but lower than the tails of t-Distribution's with sample size of 2
                In t-Distribution, when sample size is 15,
                    the mean peak will be lower than Normal Distribution's peak and t-Distribution's with sample size of 15
                    tails will be higher than Normal Distribution's tails and t-Distribution's with sample size of 15

            f-Distribution
                A ratio of 2 Chi-squared distributions
                Denoted by the degrees of freedom for the numerator Chi Squared and denominator Chi squared
                Formula:
                    F = Ssq1 / Ssq2
                    where S is the standard deviation
                    If F = 1, there is no difference in the variance
                    Numerator should be greater than denominator, (df1 = n1, df2 = n2-1)
                From f-Distribution table, critical fDistribution at alpha and dof of 2 different process samples (df1 and df2) can be determined

    #Collecting and Summarizing Data    
        Types of Data
            Discrete Data OR Attribute Data
                Data that can be counted: quantity, frequency
                Examples:
                    Number of defects,
                    Percentage of defects
                    Frequency of breakdowns
                    Good vs Bad,
                    etc
                    
            Continuous Data OR Variable Data
                Data that can be measured on a continuous scale: Length, volume, distance
                    Examples:
                        Height,
                        Weight,
                        Time,
                        Temperature,
                        etc
            
            Assuring Data Accuracy
                To ensure data is accurate, data sampling is carried out
                Sampling is a texhnique of selecting appropriate sample from a group
                Types of sampling:
                    Random Sampling: Chosen data at random from larger group of subject 
                    Sequential Sampling: Data chosen from larger group of subject for a period of time
                    Stratified Sampling: Categorize the larger group into smaller sub group in accordance to population parameter and take data from this sub group

        Simple Random Sampling VS Stratified Sampling
            Simple:
                Possibility of erroneous results is high 
                Cannot indicate possible causes of variation
            Stratified:
                Minimized possibility of errors
                Capable of showing the causes of variation

        Data coding
            A process of converting and condensing raw data into categories and sets so that it can be used for further analysis
            Simplifies large quantities of data
            Enables easy entry of process data into computers
            Facilitates data analysis
            Enables organized data representation
            Eliminates data repetition

        Descriptive Statistics - Measures of Central Tendency
            A single value that indicates the central point in a set of data
            Common measures of central tendency
                Mean: Average 
                Median: Middle number
                Mode: Most frequent
                Outlier: In a list of dataset, the outlier is the extreme number that is "off the scale" from the grouping. (Example: The billionaires in the middle income population)
                    Mean result will be skewed due to the presence of outliers.
                    Median result will be unchanged

        Descriptive Statistics - Measures of Dispersion
            Describes the spread of values.
            The higher the variation of data points, the higher the spread of data
            3 main measures of dispersion:
                Range: The difference between the largest and smallest value of data
                Variance (Symbol: Sigma Squared)
                    Variance is a measure of variation and cannot be considered as variation in dataset
                    Population variance is preferred over sample variance as it is a more accurate indicator of variation                     
                    Variance = [Sum of (xi - xbar)^2] / (n - 1)
                    Population Variance in Excel: VARP()
                    Sample Variance in Excel: VARS()
                    Example: 4,8,1,6,6,2,9,3,6,9
                        Ans: Sample Variance = 8.04, Population Variance = 7.24
                Standard Deviation (Symbol: Sigma)
                    Standard Deviation = Square Root of  Variance
                    Population standard deviation in Excel = STDEVP() 
                    Sample Standard Deviation in Excel = STDEV()
                    Example: 4,8,1,6,6,2,9,3,6,9
                        Population Std Dev = 2.69
                        Sample Std Dev = 2.83

        Descriptive Statistics - Frequency Distribution
            A grouping of data into categories showing the number of observation
            Table:
            No. of Cars | Freq.
            0                 | 4
            1                 | 6
            2                 | 5
            3                 | 3
            4                 | 2
            
        Cumulative Frequency Table
            Similar to Frequency Distribution Table)
            The difference is that it has 3 more columns:
                Cumulative Frequency,
                Percentage,
                Cumulative Percentage
        
        Dataset:
            37, 49, 54, 91, 60, 62, 65, 77, 67, 81
            LV = Lower Value
            UV = Upper Value
            F = Frequency
            CF = Cumulative Frequency
            % = Percentage
            CP = Cumulative Percentage
        
        | LV | UV | F  | CF | %  | CP  |
        | 35 | 44  | 1 | 1  | 10 | 10  | 
        | 45 | 54  | 2 | 3  | 20 | 30  | 
        | 55 | 64  | 2 | 5  | 20 | 50  | 
        | 65 | 74  | 2 | 7  | 20 | 70  | 
        | 75 | 84  | 2 | 9  | 20 | 90  | 
        | 85 | 94  | 1 |10  | 10 |100  | 

        Graphical Method - Stem and Leaf Plots
            Used for representing data in a graphical format to visualize the shape of distribution
            Example: Temp for a month:
                78, 81, 82, 68, 65, 59, 62, 58, 51, 62, 62, 71, 69, 64, 67, 71, 62, 65, 65, 74, 76, 87, 82, 82, 83, 79, 79, 71, 82, 77, 81
                Table:

                Median = 12 (7th number)
                
                Step 3: Find lower and upper quartile (Midpoint between median)
                Lower Quartile = 8.5 (Since the midpoint is between 8 and 9, 8.5 will be the Lower Quartile)
                Upper Quartile = 14 (Since the midpoint is between 14, the 14 will be the Upper Quartile)

                Step 4: Draw number line to include all data points (A ruler indicating the points)

                    As X (Horizontal value) increases, Y (Vertical value) decrease proportionally
                    Descending Linear graph

        Graphical Method - Histogram
            Similar to bar graphs but the bars represent intervals of subgroups in ascending/descending order
            Best suited for continuous data

        Graphical Method - Normal Probability Plots
            Used for identifying whether a dataset is normally distributed
            Normally distributed dataset forms a straight line in a normal probability plot
            Example:

    #Measurement System Analysis
        A technique that identifies measurement error (variation) and its sources to reduce variation
        Used throughout the DMAIC process.
        Error prone MSA leads to incorrect conclusions
        The capability is calculated, analyzed and interpreted using Gage Repeatability and Reproducibility (GR&R) to determine:
            -measurement correlation,
            -bias,
            -linearity,
            -percent agreement,
            -precision/tolerance

        Objectives:
            To obtain information about type of measurement variation of measurement system
            Establish criteria to accept and release new measuring equipment
            Compare one measure method with another
            Form basis for evaluating a method suspected of being deficient
            Variations must be resolved to ensure correct baselines
        
        Observed Value, Measurement Variability & Process Variability 
            Observed Value = True Value +- Measurement Error
            Measurement error is net effect of all sources of measurement variability causing observedvalue to deviate from true value
            
            True Variability = Process variability + Measurement variability
            Measurement variable and process variable must be evaluated and improved together

            If process variable is addressed while measurement variable continues to be significant, process improvement is invalid

        Measurement Error types:
            Bias
                Involves calibration study
                mu(total) = mu(process) +- mu(measurement)
            Variations
                Involves GR&R study
                sigma^2(total) = sigma^2(process) +- sigma^2(measurement) 

        Sources of variation
            Observed Process Variation:-
                Actual Process Variation (aka Part variation)
                    Long term process variation
                    Short Term process variation
                    variation within a sample
                Measurement Variation
                    Variation due to operators: Reproducibility
                    Variation due to Gage: Repeatability
                    Variation within a sample

        Gage Repeatability and Reproducibility
            Repeatability:
                Variation in measurement obtained when one operator measures repeatedly
                Example: Getting variations for measuring the same hole 3 times with same calipers
                It can be either operator error of equipment error (Equipment Variation - EV)
            Reproducibility:
                Average of measurements made by different operators performing Repeatability Operations
                Example: Getting variations between operators for measuring the same hole 3 times with same calipers
                Aka Appraiser Variation - AV
            NOTE: It is important to resolve equipment variation before resolving appraiser variation

        GR&R Guidelines
            Should be performed over the range of expected observations
            Actual equipment should be used
            Written procedures or approved practices should be followed
            Measurement variability should be presented as is
            After GR&R, variables should be seperated into causal components, prioritized, and targeted for action

        GR&R Concepts
            Bias:
                Distance between sample mean value and sample true value (aka accuracy)
                Bias = Mean - Ref Val. Process Variation = 6 std dev
                Bias% = Bias / Process Variation
            Linearity:
                Consistency of bias over the range of the gage
                Linearity = Graph Slope * Process Variation
            Precision:
                Degree of repeatability or closeness of data
                The smaller the dispersion, the better the precision
                sigma^2(gage) = sigma^2(repeatability) + sigma^2(reproducibility)

        GR&R Data Collection
            Number of operators are usually 3
            Number of units to measure is usually 10
            General sampling techniques are used to represent population
            Number of trials for each operator is 2 to 3
            Gage is checked for calibration and resolution
            Units are measured by the first operator in random order, same order followed by other operators
            Each trial is repeated

        ANOVA
            Pro: 
                The best method for analyzing GR&R studies
                Separates equipment and operator variation
                Provides insight on the combined effect of the two 
                Uses standard deviation as a measure of variation for better estimates
            Cons:
                Time taken
                Resources required
                Cost

        Interpretation of Measurement System Analysis (See GR&R Template)
            MSA Result
                Reproducibility Error > Repeatability Error
                    Operators are not adequately trained using the gauge
                    Calibrations on the gauge dial are not clear
                Repeatability Error > Reproducibility Error
                    Gauge needs maintenance
                    Gauge needs to be redesigned to be more rigid
                    Gauging location needs improvement
                    Ambiguity is present in SOPs
            Check value of %GRR. If result is less than 30%, then gauge is acceptable
            If EV = 0, MS is reliable and gauge variation is contributed by operators, therefore provide operators with training to resolve AV
            If AV = 0, MS is precise
            The interaction between operators and parts can also be studied under GRR using Part Variation (PV)
            Trueness and precision cannot be determined in a GRR if only one gauge or measurement method is evaluated as it may have inherent bias

    #Process and Performance Capabilities
        Control Limits aka Natural Process Limits
            Derived from data
            Voice of the process
            Realtime values
            Based on past performance
            Indicates variation in the process
            Consist of UCL and LCL
        Specification Limits
            Based on customer requirements
            Voice of customer
            Targets set for the process
            If not met, product is defective
            Consist of USL and LSL
            Difference between USL and LSL is tolerance
        NOTE: 
            If the limits lie within spec limits, process is under control. 
            If spec limit lie within control limits, process will not meet customer requirements     

        Process Perfomance Metrics (DPU and DPMO)
            DPU (Defects per Unit)
                DPU = Defects / Total Units
            DPMO (Defects per Millionth Opportunities)
                DPMO = Defects per opportunity * 1,000,000

        Calculating Process Performance
            Example:
            QC checks quality of finished goods by sampling batch of 10 items from produced lot every hour
            In 24 hours:
                Defects: 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2
                Total number of defects = 34
                Subgroup size = 10
            If the sample size is constant, pbar or DPU is used to calculate process capability
                Total number of units = Subgroup Size * Total Groups = 10*24 = 240
                DPU = Total Defects / Total Units = 34/240 = 0.0142
                DPMO = DPU * 1,000,000 = 141666.66
            Therefore, it can be observed that the process is currently working at 2.6sigma, which is 86.4% yield

        Process Stability Studies
            Activities under measure phase: 
                MSA, Collection of Data, Statistical Calculation, Checking for Accuracy and Checking for Validity
                This is followed by a test for stability under Process Stability Study            
            Why a process becomes unstable:
                Due to special cause of variation. 
                    Multiple special cause leads to Instability. 
                    Single special cause leads to Out-of-control Condition
            Process instability can be checked using Run Charts in Minitab
                If p-values is less than 0.05, process has special causes of variation
                Chances of process going unstable is high
                
            Types of Causes of Variation
                Common Causes of Variation
                    Include the many sources of variation within a process
                    Have a stable and repeatable distribution over a period
                    Contribute to a state of statistical control where the output is predictable
                Special Causes of Variation
                    Include factors external to and not always acting on the process
                    Irregular in nature
                    Contribute to instability of a process output
                    May result in defects and have to be eliminated
                    If indicated by Run Charts, stop the process and perform root cause analysis

            Verifying Process Stability and Normality
                Causes of Variation existing in a process are used to verify its normaluty or stability
                If special causes of variation are present, process distribution changes and output are not stable (Process is Not in Control)
                If only common causes of variation are present, the output is stable and process is in control
                NOTE: For stable process, Control Charts can be used to calculate the process capability.

        Process Capability Study
            An actual variation in the process specification
            Steps:
                Plan for Data Collection > Collect Data > Plot and Analyze Results
            Appropriate sampling plan depends on the purpose and whether there are any customer requirements for the study
            Pilot run may be used to estimate process capability for new processes

            Objectives:
                To establish a state control over a manufacturing process and then maintain control over time period

            Objective tree:
                Compare natural Process limits within specification limits >
                    Process limits fall within specs > 
                        No action required
                    Process spread and specification spread are similar >
                        Adjust process centering to bring the batch within specification limits
                    Process limits fall outside specs
                        Reduce variability by partitioning and targeting the largest offender

            Identifying Characteristics for a process capability study
                Requirements:
                    Characteristics should indicate a key factor in the quality of the product or process
                    It should be possible to influence the value of the characteristic through process adjustments
                    The operating conditions that affect the characterisitcs should be defined and controlled
                The characteristics to be measured may also be determined by customer purchase order requirements or industry standards
    
            Identifying Specification and Tolerances
                Defined by industry standards based on customer requirements
                Defined by organization's engineering department in consultation with the customer

            Process Performance Index
                Defined as a statistical measure of the outcome from a process
                Differs from Process Capability, since state of statistical control is not required in process performance
                3 indexes:
                    Pp: Process Performance
                        Pp = (USL-LSL) / 6sigma
                        where, 6sigma is the Natural process Variation
                    Ppk: Process Performance Index
                        Ppk = Min(Ppu, Ppl)
                        Ppu (Upper process capability index) = (USL-xbar) / 3sigma
                        Ppl (Lower process capability index) = (xbar-LSL) / 3sigma
                        xbar = Process Average
                    Ppm/Cpm: Process Capability Index
                        Cpm = (USL-LSL) / 6 * [sqrt(sigma^2) + (mu-T)^2] = (USL-LSL) / 6 * sqrt[sum(Xi-T)^2 / (n-1)]
                        where,
                        mu = process average
                        T = Target value (center of tolerance)
                        Xi = sample reading
                        n = number of sample readings

            Key terms
                Zst (Short term capability) : 
                    Capability or the potential performance of the process in control at any point of time
                    Based on the sample collected in the short term
                Zlt (Long term performance) :
                    Actual performance of the process over time
                Subgroups :
                    Several small sized samples collected consecutively
                    Chosen so that data points are identical within a subgroup and different between subgroups
                Process Shift (Zst-Zlt):
                    Refllects how well a process is controlled, usually a factor of 1.5

            Illustrations:
                Short Term Capability:
                    Imagine 3 bell curves with center means defined,  placed on top of each other according to time (vertical axis, "time 1" = lowest, "time 3" highest)
                    LSL and USL on the horizontal axis where LSL is on the left, USL on the right
                    With that said, the layered bell curves were shifted to the right from each other
                    The means will look like a linear graph (ascending as it approaches USL)
                    Now the differences between the means of all the bell curves are called "Sigma Shifts", an indicator of process control
                    Typical sigma shift is approximately 1.5 standard deviations where sigma is the standard deviation
                    Therefore, Time1 bell curve and time 2 bell curve is 1.5 sigma shift
                    Time 2 bell curve and Time 3 bell curve is 1.5 sigma shift
                    Shift could be due to different operators, raw materials, wear and tear, time, etc
                Long Term:
                    With Short Term capability graph above, add in a larger bell curve,
                    Where the LSL and USL are aligned to the Short Term's LSL and USL
                    This single bell curve overlaps all the short term capability bell curves 

            Assumptions and Conventions
                Short Term Variation:
                    Attributed to common cause variation
                    Variances are inherent in the process
                    Shows variation within subgroup
                    Small number of samples collected at short intervals
                    Captures common cause variation
                    Common causes are difficult to identify and correct 
                    Process needs to redesign in order to remove common causes variation
                Long Term Variation
                    Attributed to both common and special cause variation and variations caused by external factors
                    Aka overall variation
                    Shows variation within subgroups, and between subgroups
                    Includes special causes such as changes in operators, raw material, wear and tear
                    Special causes have to be identified and corrected for process improvement

            Comparing Cpk and Cp
                Compare Cpk and Cp :-
                    Cpk < Cp  
                        Mean is not centered, the shift in the mean results in a shift in long term sigma levels
                    Cpk = Cp
                        Mean is centered, process is considered capable if Cpk > 1, when variations are in control
                    Cpk > Cp 
                        Impossible by definition, calculations need to be rechecked

                Formula:
                    Average of Each Week = Total complaints per week / Subgroup Size
                    Grand Average = Sum of per week average / 3
                    Variation within subgroups for a week = Sum(Week Average - x)^2, where x is each reading per week
                    Variation between subgroups per week = (Grand Average - Week 1 Average)^2 * Nsg1
                    Total Variation within subgroups = Sum(Variation within subgroups for each week)
                    Total Variation between subgroups = Sum(Variation between subgroups for each week)
                    Overall variation = Total variation within subgroups + Total variation between subgroups
                    St Dev Short Term = Sst = Sqrt[Total variation within subgroups / (Total sample size - number of subgroups)]
                    St Dev Long Term = Slt = Sqrt[Overall Variation / (Total sample size - 1)]
                
                Result:
                | Measure                           | Value   |

                From the table, it can be seen that the effects of a mean shift become more negligible as the process
                capability increases. A 6Sigma process's level of defects is not affected much by long term variation

        Process Capability for Attribute Data
            For attribute data, process capability is determined by the mean rate of non-conformance and DPMO is the measure used
            Mean and Standard Deviation must be defined
            Defectives:
                Pbar:
                    Used for checking process capability for constant and variable sample sizes
                    sqrt[Pbar(1-Pbar)/n]
            Defects:
                Cbar: Used when the sample size is constant
                Ubar: Used when the sample size is variable
                    sqrt(Ubar/a) ; sqrt(Cbar)
            NOTE: Pbar, Ubar and Cbar are the equivalent of standard deviation for continuous data

    //Exploratory Data Analysis   
        Multi-Vari Studies
            Analyzes variation, 
            Investigate Process Stability, 
            Identify investigation areas and, 
            Breaks down the variation
            
            Classifies variation sources into 3 major type
                Positional
                    Are variations within a single unit where variation is due to location
                    Examples: Pallet stacking in a truck, temperature gradient in oven, region of a country, etc
                Cyclical
                    Variations among sequantial repetitions over a short time
                    Example: Batch to batch variation, lot to lot variation, etc
                Temporal
                    Variations which occur over longer periods of time
                    Similar to cyclical but only that the sampling time distance is longer (Analyzing monsoon season rainfall this year and last year)
                    Examples: Process drift, performance before and after breaks, seasonal based differences, economic recessions 2008 vs 2020, etc

            5 Steps to create Multi-Vari Chart

                1. Select Process and Characteristics
                        Select the process where the plate is being manufactured
                        Measure its thickness within a specified range
                        Any plate with thickness outside the specified range is a defect
                2. Decide Sample Size
                        Sample size is 5 pieces from each equipment
                        Frequency of data collection is every 2 hours                        
                3. Create Tabulation Sheet
                        Tabulation sheet with data records contains the columns "time", "equipment number" and "thickness" as headers
                4. Plot the Chart
                        Chart is then plotted with time on X axis (Horizontal axis) and the plate thickness on Y axis (Vertical axis)
                5. Link the Observed Values
                        The observed values are linked by appropriate lines

    //Simple Linear Correlation
        Calculates the direction of movement of Y as the X changes (ascending or descending)
        The association between variables
        The Coefficient of Correlation shows the strength of the relationship between Y and X 
        Correlation is used to associate Y with X, and statistically validate the relationship
        Excel: =CORREL(A1:A6, B1:B6), where A and B are columns
        The dependant variable Y may indedepent on other variable (X)
        Correlation is used to find the behavior of Y as one of the Xs changes
        Correlation helps to predict the direction of  movement in values in Y when X changes

        'r' of Pearson's Coefficient of Correlation, If x increase, Y decrease
            -1 : Movement in both variables in inverse
            0  : No correlation between the two
            +1  : Movement in both variables is same, as X increase, Y also increase
            'r' value of >+0.85 or <-0.85 indicates a strong correlation

        Scatter plots:
            r=0.07, Plots are scatterd and more dispersed than r=0.45
            r=0.45, Plots are not dispersed but you can tell the direction (whether it's ascending or descending)
            r=0.90, scatter plots fall nicely along an ascending linear graph
            r=-0.90, scatter plots fall nicely along a descending linear graph

        Calculation:
            Corr test was performed on the scores of a set of students from first grade to university
            The score under university, correlation was the dependent variable
            The first grade score was independent
            Correlation coefficient was 0.29
            Correlation coefficient score between university and high school was 0.45
                This states the the performance of student in high school is a better indicator of their performance in university than their first grade
                As both values are less than 0.85, it is diffficult to draw a straight line on scatter plot

    ///////////////////////////
    //Regression
        Calculates the degree of movement of Y as the X changes
        If a high percentage of variability in Y (r^2>70%) is explained by changes in X, the model to write a transfer function equation is:
            Y = f(X)
            This equation is for predicting future values of Y given X or vice versa
            Regress Y on one ormore Xs simultaneously
            Simple linear regression is for on X and Multiple Linear Regression is for multiple Xs

        Key concepts of regression
            Transfer function to control Y
                Can't control Y because there may be low level of correlation between 2 variables
            Vital X
                It is important to discover whether a statistical significant relationship exists between Y and X by looking at P-values.
                Based on regression, one can find out the vital X value and eliminate the rest
                
             Note: It is important to understand if there is statistical relevance between X and Y using the metrics from Regression Analysis
                Simple Linear Regression should be used as a Statistical Validation Tool
             
        Simple Linear Regression
            Is a fitted linear equation between Y and X
            Equation: Y = A + BX +- C
                where,
                    Y = Dependent variable/output/response
                    X = Independent variable/output/predictor
                    A = Intercept of fitted line on Y axis / Where the graph intercepts Y axis
                    B = Regression coefficient/Slope of fitted line
                    C = Error in model

            Least Squares Method
                If X and Y are not perfectly linear (r = +-1), several lines could fit in the scatter plot
                It can be inferred from the graphs: Any plot that is plotted away from the line is called an error
                    The distance from the point to the line is the error distance used in Sum of Squares of Error (SSE)
                Minitab fits the line which has the least SSE
                In linear relationship, the points would lie on the line. Typically, the data lies off the line

            Example:
                | Years | Fertilizer       | Annual          |
                |       | Expenses in $(Y) | selling in $(X) |

                In Excel:
                    Copy and paste data into cell B1 to C6
                    Select "Plain Scatter Plot Chart"
                        Main Menu > Insert > Plain Scatter Plot Chart (Scatter with only markers)
                    Right click the datapoints in scatter chart and select "Add Trendline"
                    Select "Linear" and select boxes titled "Display R-Squared value"
                    Select Display Equation
                        Linear line (Best fit line / least square line) will appear
                
                Regression Analysis:
                    r^2 value (Coefficient of Determination) conveys if the model is good and can be used
                    The r^2 value is 0.3797
                    38% of variability in Y is explained by X
                    The remaining 62% variation is due to residual factors
                    Low value of r^2 validates a poor relationship between Y and X

        Multiple Linear Regression
            If new variable X2 is added to the above question r^2 model, the impact of X1 and X2 on Y gets tested
            Value of r^2 changes due to the new variable and be called "r^2 adjusted"
            If r^2 Adjusted value is greater than 70%, the model can be used

            Key Concepts:
                The residual between the actual value and the predicted value give an indication of how  good the model is
                If the errors are small and the prediction uses Xs that are within the range of collected data, the predictions should be good
                Equation:
                    Total = Regression + Error
                    Sum of Square Total (SST) = Sum of Square Regression (SSR) + Sum of Squares Error (SSE)
                    r^2 = Regression (SSR) / Total (SST)
                Prioritization of Xs can be done through SLR equation.
                    Run separate regressions on Y with each X
                If X does not explain variation in Y, it should not be explored further

            Difference between Correlation and Causation
                Regression equation denotes a relationship between variables but does not indicate:
                - if change in one variable causes change in the other
                - both variables may be dependaent on another independent variable
                Example:
                    There is a positive correlation between number of sneezes and number of deaths
                    But it cannot be assumed the sneezing is the cause of death despite the correlation is very strong

    ///////////////////////////
    //Hypothesis Testing
        Statistically significant differences between variables and hypothesized values may be not be practical and economically meaningful
        Example:
            Based on hypothesis test, ABC Inc wants to implement a trading company which is proven to provide statistically significant return.
            However, it does not guarantee trading on this strategy will provide significant positive economic return due to taxes, transaction costs, risks

        Null Hypothesis VS Alt Hypothesis
            If null hypothesis is rejected, alt hypothesis must be right
            Null:
                Represented as H0
                Cannot be proved, can only reject
            Alt:
                Represented as Ha 
                Challenges the null hypothesis

        TypeI and TypeII error
            Type I Error:
                Rejecting null hypothesis when it is true
                Aka Producer's Risk
                Alpha is the chance of committing Type I error
                The value of alpha is 0.05 or 5%
            Type II Error:
                Accepting a null hypothesis when it is false
                Aka Consumer's Risk
                Beta is the chance of committing Type II error
                The value of Beta is 0.2 or 20%
                Any experiment should have less beta value as possible

        Points to remember:
            Probability of making one type of error increases the probability of the other type of error
                Type 1 error will increase when specs of product increases surpassing customer's requirements (decreasing Type 2 error)
            If a true null hypothesis is erroneously rejected (Type I error), a false null hypothesis may be accepted (Type II error)
            Typical alpha (Type I) error is set at 0.05 which means committing type I error will be 1/20 experiments
            Important to decide what type of error should be less and set alpha and beta accordingly

        Power of Test
            Is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false
            Is represented as 1-beta (Type II error)
            Is the probability of not committing Type II error
            Helps improve the advantage of hypothesis testing
            The higher the value, the better the choice for the test to be chosen
            Alpha = Significance level. 
            1-Alpha = Confidence level

        Standard Sample Size Formula (Continuous Data)
            The value alpha is taken as 5%
            According to Z table, the Z97.5 is 1.96
            Sample Size Formula:
                n = [(1.96*sigma)/delta]^2 

            Question:
                The population standard deviation for the time to resolve customer problems is 30 hours.
                What should be the size of a sample that can estimate the average problem resolution time within +-5 hours tolerance with 99% confidence?
            
            Answer:
                Delta=5
                sigma=30
                alpha=0.01
                Z99.5=2.575
                Sample size = [(2.575*30)/5]^2 = 239

        Standard Sample Size Formula (Discrete Data)
            If the average population's proportion non defective is 'p', then population standard deviation can be calculated
            sigma = sqrt of (p(1-p))
            n = [1.96/delta]^2
            p(1-p)
            where delta = To;erance allowed on either side of the population proportion average in %
            
            Question:
                The non-defective population proportion for pen manufacturing is 80%
                What should be theh sample size to draw a sample that can estimate the proportion of compliant pens within +-5% with an alpha of 5%?
            Answer:
                Delta = 0.05
                sigma 2 = 0.8(1-0.8)
                alpha = 0.05
                Z97.5 = 1.96
                Sample size = [(1.96/0.05)^2] * 0.8 * 0.2 = 245.86 = 246
                Sample size of lesser than 245 reduces confidence level

            Sample size (n) = 117, (Z-test) and sample size (n) = 25 (t-test);
            Sample average (Xbar) = 164.5

            Z-test (known sigma)
                The population StdDev is known; sigma = 5.2
                Compute z = (Xbar - u0) / [sqrt(sigma^2 / n)] = (165-164.5) / sqrt (5.2^2 / 117) = 1.04
                Reject H0 at level of significance alpha if z is greater than z alpha
                Since Z0.05 = 1.96, the null hypothesis is not rejected at 5% level of significance
                Conclusion: Based on the sample collected, average height of American males is 165cm
            
            t-test (unknown sigma)
                The population StdDev is unknown
                However, estimated from the sample StdDev, s = 5.0 
                Compute t = (Xbar - u0) / sqrt (s^2 / n) = (165 - 164.4) / sqrt (5^2 / 25) = 0.5
                Reject H0 at level of significance alpha if t is greater than t(n-1), alpha
                Since t24, 0.05 = 2.064, the null hypothesis is not rejected at 5% level of significance
                Conclusion: Based on the sample collected is that the average height of American males is 165cm

        Hypothesis Test for Variance
            Chi squared is used in hypothesis test for variance
            H0: Proportion of wins in Australia or abroad is independent of the country played against
            Ha: Proportion of wins in Australia or abroad is dependent on the country played against
            
            IF:
                X^2critical = 6.251
                X^2calculated = 1.36                
            Result: Since calculated value is less than critical value, the proportion of wins of Australia is independent of the country played or place
