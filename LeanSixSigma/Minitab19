    //Structure
        Consists of 3 panels (Project Manager, Session and Worksheet)
        A Minitab Project contains worksheet. Like Excel file contains multiple spreadsheet tabs
        Therefore, *.mpj = *.xls
        The worksheet panel is similar to the Spreadsheet Tabs in Excel
        
    //"Worksheet 1" Panel:
        #Structure
            Excel spreadsheet index starts with 1, Minitab worksheet index starts with 0 (nameless row)
            The empty row (row without index) is reserved for column title
            To copy over a column (with column title) from excel, paste it on index 0 of the minitab worksheet
            If pasted over index 1, minitab will automatically formats the column as 'texts' even your data has numbers in them
        
        #Column Formats (The columns autoformat to text, date and numbers)
            D - Date (#/#/##, ##:##:##, #-###-####, am/pm)
            T - Text
            For numbers, no changes to the column name
            Delete entire column and the column format disappears
            
            Change format manually
                Right Click on column and select Format Column
            
        #Rename the worksheet        
            Open Project Manager panel and under Tree viewer, rename "Worksheet 1" folder
                Project Tree > Worksheet > Worksheet 1

        #Adding Formulas
            #Simple
            Each section can contain formulas just like Excel
            
            #Complicated fomulas
            Left Click on the column index to highlight the entire column
            Right Click > Select Formulas > Assign Formula to Column
            Example Expression: 'ColumnTitle01' + 'ColumnTitle02'
            Symbol will appear in the Column index
            
    //Show worksheet Folder
        A project may contain multiple worksheet and to see all of them, you can open he worksheet tree
        Main Menu > Toolbar > Multiple window Icon (Show worksheet Folder)
            Located below the "Assistant" menu
            
    //Exporting
        #Export Graphs
            Right Click on Graph and select "Send to MS Word" or "Send to MS Powerpoint"
        #Export Data Tables to MS Words
            Main Menu > Data > Display Data, and select the columns    #This will transfer worksheet data into the session panel
            Right click on Session panel, Send Section to MS Words or MS Powerpoint
            #Note: In the session panel, you can export highlighted lines into Words and Powerpoint

                    BlueDot = more than 80%
                    This means that 80% of the time, they analyze a good part from the bad part

        Run Chart will appear in a new window with each blue dot representing the waiting time
        From first dot to 300th, the wait time is about 45 to 80
        But from 300th to 400th dots, there is a jump to 180 to 200 in waiting time
        At 400th to 500th, wait time drops to 120-ish
        500th to 680th, Wait time variation is 50 to 180
        
        From the data above, we conclude that there is alot of variance in the data before improvement
        After realizing the variances, assess the data for its symmetry/skewness.
        This can be done with Histogram

            The highest peak in the graph shows 80 patients waited for 60 minutes
            The distribution is positively skewed since the peak is on the left side of the graph

        Interpretation of Continuous Data Chart
            2 charts generated, Individual Value and Moving Range
            Vertical Axis is the Wait Time, Horizontal Axis is the patient by index number
            Under Individual Value Chart, Patient 20 hits the upper limit (UCL) of wait time
            Under Moving Range Chart, the vertical axis is the excess time (Note the 0-3 on the vertical axis)
                Patient 20 and 21 is beyond the UCL but under individual chart, patient 21 wait time is around the Xbar
                This means that patient 20's excessive waiting time affected patient 21 waiting time

12. Green Belt Case Study 02 (Fibonacci Technologies)
    //Data
        #Developed  a banking software with multiple modules
        #Module X and Module Y were critical for performance
        #These 2 modules were to be tested and debug
        #Fibonacci hired 3rd party company (Caliper) to handle the project
        #Caliper's team (1 project manager, 2 consultants) - all trained in Lean Six Sigma
        #Their 5 steps method for improvements: DMAIC
            Define:
                Two modules were documented in detail after getting the requirements for
                the various functionalities and their criticality
                Project manager assigned Modules X and Y to both his consultants individually
                Both are measure based upon their suitability to the work requirements
            Measure:
                The team measured the data of all the debugging activities throughout the day
                And was compiled at the end of the day by the project manager
            Analyze:
                They then analyzed the 3 weeks worth of data with Minitab
            Improvement:
                They then improve the uneven distribution of work between the 2 consultants
                This was achieved by relocating a part of the work containing higher 
                debugging time to the consultant who has lower debugging time during the day
            Control:
                The debugging time was managed closely over a period
                
        #The team was able to complete the work 10 days before the estimated completion time

12. Green Belt Case Study 02 (Analysis)

    //Sorting
        #Sort data in one column or more, in increasing or decreasing order
        #Sorted data can be stored in original columns or in new worksheet
        #Columns that are sorted together must be of the same length
        #Data:
            S/N  | Role                         |  Estimated Hours | Cost_Per_Hr ($)
            1      | Project manager      |  200                      | 100
            2      | Consultant 1            |  500                      | 70
            3      | Consultant 2            |   500                     | 70
        #Add a new colulmn and name this column as "Total Cost"
        
        #Estimation based on entered data
            #Calculate total cost
            Main Menu > Calc >
                Store result in variable: Total Cost
                Expression: Hour * Cost_Per_Hr
                Click OK
            Calculated result will appear in the Total Cost column

        #Apply formulas to new Column
            Right Click on column title and select Formulas > Assign Formulas to Column
            The calculator will appear but without the "Store Result in" input box
                Expression: Hour * Cost_Per_Hr
            The result will be displayed in the selected column

        #Change data type for a column
            Avoiding the serial number column from being used for any calculation
            Changing numerical value column to a string
            Main Menu > Data > Change Data type > Numeric to Text
                Change Numeric Columns: S/N Column
                Store text Columns: S/N Column (This will be stored into the same column)

            Cpk = 0.54  #Since it's low value, it's operating between 1sigma and 2sigma
            USL:22
            LSL:14 #Productivity may fall below 14 bugs per day (as shown by the overall line) which is below the LSL
            Data needs to be collected more than 30 days for better interpretation
