01. Lean Manufacturing vs Six Sigma
    //Lean manufacturing (Eliminates Wastes)
        Lean believes any process can be optimized by eliminating the 8 main wastes (TIMWOOD)
            Transport
            Inventory
            Motion
            Waiting
            Over Processing
            Over Production
            Defects
    
    //Six Sigma (Eliminates Process Variation)
        SixSigma believes you can optimize a process by eliminating process variation
        A structured approach is used (DMAIC)
            Define
            Measure
            Analyze
            Improve
            Control
    
    //Similarities
        Improve Quality Improve Service and Reduce Costs
        
    //LeanSixSigma
        Using DMAIC process to reduce process variations and at the same time eliminate wastes
        This is usually done in what is known as a Kaizen Event
            4-5 weeks before Kaizen Event     => Define and Measure Phase
            Kaizen Week                       => Analyze and Improve Phase
            90 days after Kaizen event        => Control Phase

    //A3 document
        After Project Charter is created, an A3 document is generated
        A one page project summary that allows team members, project managers and stakeholders to communicate about the milestones, advances and roadblocks
        Usually the information created during the project charter phase is used to fill out the A3 document

        Common Format:
            Define Stage
                Project background

                    Graphs and sketches
                SMART Goals
            Measure, Analyze and Improve Stage
                Root Cause Analysis:
                    To communicate the root cause of the problem

            Control Stage        
                Follow up Control Phase
                    How will the process be monitored

    //Steps
        Fill out project Charter
        Fill out A3 document
        Identify key stakeholders
        Create SMART Goal
        Define the project scope and team members

03. Measure Phase
    //Objective:
        Understanding the process, 
        Evaluate the measurement system 
        Establish the baseline process capability

    //Create
        Process flow map
        Measurement System Analysis (MSA) with Gage R&R and Kappa Test
        Graphs and Charts:
            Balance Charts
            Pareto Charts
            Graphical Summaries
            Boxplots
            Takt Time Analysis
            
    //Steps
        #Create Process flow diagram - Production Line
            Chassis Assy > Fit Body > Paint > Fit Engine > Fit Accessories > Fit Electronics > Quality > Export
            Run the line and understand the process
                Observed bottle neck: Between the Chassis Assy and Fit Body
                Observed underutilized stations: Fit Electronics, Quality and Export 
                Take the timing of every station
                
        #Baseline process capability
            Find out current efficiency (Includes Flow time, waste output, workload balance)
            What are the defect categories
            What is the current output using historical patterns and stability
            Example Table: 
            |   Efficiency         |  Flow: 8 process steps
            |                      |  Wastes: Waiting between operations Chassis assembly and Fit body
            |                      |  Waiting between Fit Body and Paint Operation
            |                      |  Workload Balance: Bottle Neck observed between Chassis Assy, Fit Body and Paint Ops
            | Defect Categories    |  No current manufacturing defects
            | Current Output       |  2 cars/hour. Stability lasts 5 hours

        #Workload Balance Diagram:
            Record the time of each inindividual manufacturing steps
            Create a bar chart and a table
            Then create a Pareto Chart
            
        #Pareto Chart
            The bars will shuffle according to ascending order, from the highest time taken to the lowest
            The dots indicating over the bars indicate the importance in percentage
            For this example, Paint and Fit Assy indicates 50% contribution to the time wastage
            
    //Charts that you should have in Measure stage:
        Bar Chart
        Process Flow Diagram
        Spaghetti Diagram
        Pareto Chart


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
04. Analyze Phase
    //Objective:
        Understand the root cause of the process problems
        Eliminate:
            Gap difference between current level and desired level of performance
            Wastes
            Non Value Added Activities
        Methods:
            Elimination: Flow concepts and Pull Systems to eliminate waste
            Root Cause: RCA, Cause and Effect Analysis, 5 Why's
            Evaluation: Scatter Plots, Correlation and Regression Studies, ANOVA

    //Value Added/Non Value Added/Business Value Added
        Value Added: Activities that directly contributes to stisfy the customer (Time, Quality)
        Non Value Added: Things that customers will not be happy to pay for
        Business value added: Activities that customers will not be happy to pay for but are required legally (ISO Standards, Audits, International regulations)

    //Calculate Takt Time (Desired Time)
        Find out the desired output value (Example: 4 car every hour)
        Takt Time = Time(seconds)/Demand = 3600/4 = 1 car every 900 seconds
        
    //Measure Current Work Load (Work Load)
        Current Time:
            Find out how much time in total taken for 1 output 
            Record the time for each process step and each sub process step in the operation
            
        Create Bar Chart with Minitab:
            Menu > Graph > Bar Chart > 
                Bar Represents (Dropdown Menu): Values from Table
                    Simple > 
                        Graph Variables: Time Taken (Vertical Axis)
                        Categorical variable: Process Steps (Horizontal Axis)
            Add Reference Lines:
                Rigth Click on Graph > Add > Reference Line
                    Show Ref. lines at Y: 900 seconds (Takt Time)
            Change Color of the bars above the ref. line
                Right Click on the bar > Edit bars > Attributes Tab > Fill pattern: Custom >
                    Background Color: Select any color
                    
        Now we'll see the Fit Body, Paint and Fit Engine Operations are above this 900sec reference line
        Split the identified operations into its sub processes and update the main Pareto Chart
            Identify Operation > Split into subprocesses > Categoize subprocesses and Update main Pareto > RCA

    //Fit Body Operation (Identify Operation > Split operation into subprocesses > Categoize subprocesses and Update main Pareto)
        Under this operation, there are 13 sub processes
        The total time taken for the entire operation is about 32 min but we have to subdivide the total time to 13 subprocesses
        For the 13 sub processes, group them into categories and we'll find Body Frame, Roof and Doors
            Body Frame: 1256 seconds
            Roof: 276 seconds
            Doors: 388 seconds
        From here, we create another bar chart again and add the Takt Time reference line
        Find the bar that is over this reference line (900second) and you'll get the body frame
        From here, we'll create another time table for the sub processes under the bodyframe category with another bar chart
            Body Shell: 190s
            Hood: 123
            Trunk: 138
            Bumpers: 289
            Bottom Trim: 132
            252: Arches
            Vent: 130
        Now you can remove the Fit Body Operation from the main Pareto Chart and update it with Fit Body SubProcesses
        The the same with other Operations that exceeded the 900s thershold

    //RCA Steps
        Find out the slow subprocesses from the Pareto
        Cause & Effect, 5 Whys, Fishbone
        Here we found out the Chassis Assy, Drying undercoat, Dry Finish, Fit Accessories are the subprocesses that are slow processes
        Example: Multiple slow operations are executd in Paint, fitbody and fit engine operations
