//05. Animation Tab
    There are 3 Animation Panels located below the screen
        Graph Editor
        Dope Sheet
        Timeline
    Bring the foot of object to the plane
        Grab Object, Press Z, Press 1
    Animating a cube
        Move Solid to it's starting position
        Press I or (Animation Panel > Dope Sheet > Key > Insert keyframes) and Select 'Location'
            This will insert all the initial location of the solid (initialization phase)
        Move the solid to another location in the X-Axis.
        Move the Dope Sheet timeline to 24th frame and insert keyframe again
            Press I or (Animation Panel > Dope Sheet > Key > Insert keyframes) and Select 'Location'
            NOTE: This time, it will change all the updated path instead of updating the entire location list
            The bar in the timeline represents (value unchanged)
            To keyframe only the path that is affected
                Dope Sheet > Highlight the affected Axis, Select Key > Insert Keyfram and click on 'Only Selected Channels'
        Duplicating keyframes in case of adjustments to the solid
            In Dope Sheet, select the keyframe affected and duplicate (Shift+D).
            Move the duplicated keyframes to the target keyframe
            NOTE: In Animation, Object movement in 3D space won't affect the keyframes therefore duplication of keyframes is required
        Deleting an unused keyframe Channels
            In Dope Sheet, select the keyframe with the bar and presss Delete
        Adding rotation keyframes
            In Dope Sheet, move the timeline to the initial keyframe and click on the record button            
            In 3D view, highlight the object, Press R and left click without rotating to insert the rotational keyframe
            You'll see Euler Rotation andscale in the channels
            In Dope sheet, move timeline to the next keyframe.
            Rotate the object and this will automatically update the Dope Sheet by adding keyframes to all attributes
            You can also edit in the View Tab > Transform Section in the Right Hand side hidden panel. This records the angles individually
        NOTE: Try not to have keyframes close to each other as this might cause the object to glitch round.
    Euler Rotation
        The displacement of the Yaw Pitch Roll angles relative to the last object orientation in 3D space

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//06. Ball Bounce
    Create Sphere and animate (Press I to insert keyframe) OR hit the record button
    Click on object to view the keyframes
    Editor Type
        Dope Sheet - The specific frames
        Timeline - Overall frames
        Graph Editor - Speed
            Press T on sheet to bring up Interpolation section (Easing Styles - Boolean, Continuous, Triangular)
            Press V for keyframe handle type menu
        Drivers - Motion control
        Nonlinear Animation
            - When you combine or blend running cycles and motion cycles in a single timeline
            - Breaks down actions into segments
    Animate Ball Bounce
        Within Graph Editor, there should be 3 semicircle graphs where one is smaller than the other
        To extend, Open Output Tab and change end frame from 20 to 60

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//07. Bones and Armature
    Procedures similar to Head Turn Animation. Read BlenderGP.txt
    CTRL+P - Add Parent
    ALT+P - Remove Parent
    Animation
        Press I to insert keyframes.
        The rest is similar to ball bounce
    Alt+R - Remove rotations
    Bone set with Forward Kinematics (FK)
        The entire set will move according to the position of the root (backbone)
        Walking cycle is difficult since the feet will always go under the plane as the root does not adapt to the feet
    Bone set with inverse kinematics (IK) - Control bone shown outside the bone set
        The entire set will move according to the position of the root
        Instead of a single bone (backbone) being the root, it uses the hands as the root
        This will be easier to animate roller blading cycles as the feet sticks to the plane
    Import bone
        Menu > File > Append
        This adds an object to your project
    Usual bone rigs have both IK and FK built into them and base will be shown as arrows underneath the characters
    Forward Kinematics (FK) - Parent controls the children / Move elbows to control the hand
    Inverse Kinematics (IK) - Children control the parent / Hand control the elbows
    TIPS: 
        IK locks in 3D space. FK locks to body
        IK stretches, FK swings
        FK for body, IK for hands. 
        Dont use IK Controls for arc movements
        Swinging motions use FK (Walking, Punching, etc)
        Interacting with another object use IK
